lynch made the requested cuts the network was not happy with the resulting piece and declined further involvement lynch kept control of the footage he had already shot and with the help of canal plus a french distributor finished the pilot and reworked it as a film release mulholland drive premiered at the two zero zero one cannes film festival to much praise lynch was co awarded the best director prize at the festival sharing it with joel coen for the man who wasn t there it was named best picture by the new york film critics circle and even more notably was given an enthusiastic thumbs up by critic roger ebert who had previously expressed mixed feelings about lynch s work lynch was also nominated for a best directing oscar for the third time though a beautiful mind director ron howard won out nevertheless the film had little commercial success grossing just over seven million at the american box office and a further one three million globally however the film has gained cult status since its release with many interpretations floating on the internet about the film s meaning and symbolism lynch as usual for his works has not given any explanations about the film s true meaning the us and uk dvd release does contain one zero clues from the director on the inner sleeve but this has only promoted further speculation about the mysteries of the film synopsis while driving down

bits and pieces of information from the waking life are taken in a disorganized manner to construct such a dream reality under the freudian interpretation the first part of the film is a dream of the real diane <UNK> who in her dream has cast herself as the innocent and hopeful betty <UNK> and reconstructed her life history and persona into something like a hollywood movie this includes her ultimate seduction by the dark allure and hollow promises of stardom by hollywood a metaphoric seduction that is turned into a physical one in her dream the second half of the film is then the bleak

magdalene at the foot of the cross easter egg tradition for centuries it has been the custom of many christians to share dyed and painted eggs particularly on easter sunday the eggs represent new life and christ bursting forth from the tomb among eastern orthodox this sharing is accompanied by the proclamation christ is risen one tradition concerning mary magdalene says that following jesus christ s death and resurrection she used her position to gain an invitation to a banquet given by emperor tiberius caesar when she met him she held a plain egg in her hand and exclaimed christ is risen caesar laughed and said that christ rising from the dead was as likely as the egg in her hand turning red while she held it before he finished speaking the egg in her hand turned a bright red and she continued proclaiming the gospel to the entire imperial house there is also a supposed tradition that the remnants of christ s heart remain inside an egg like vessel and that this vessel is the basis for the sacred heart motif in catholicism in some legends the sacred heart exists as a guarded sacred object or a metaphysical essence passed from hand to hand with mary magdalene being listed among noteworthy <UNK> a group of scholars have suggested that for one early group of christians mary magdalene was a leader of the early church and maybe even the unidentified beloved disciple to whom the fourth gospel commonly called gospel of john is ascribed the most familiar of the scholars is elaine <UNK> ramon k <UNK> offers an explanation of this unorthodox view based on the textual researches of raymond e brown a biblical scholar in mary magdalene author of the fourth gospel one nine nine eight available on line ann graham brock see ref summarized this reading of the texts in two zero zero three she demonstrated that an early christian writing portrays authority as being represented in mary magdalene or in the church community structure these scholars also observe that the mary magdalene figure is consistently elevated in writings from which formal leadership roles are absent while the paul figure is more involved in a tug of war between these two opposing systems of church government scholars of the mary who appears in the nag hammadi gnostic texts have identified her with the magdalene even though she is merely given the coptic equivalent of mary however stephen j shoemaker thinks that this mary is actually the blessed virgin mary shoemaker two zero zero one that this fits in better with the notions that mary was intimate with jesus was his greatest disciple and was to be the center of jesus religion shoemaker has made a study of marian liturgies and devotion in early christianity the gospel of mary mary magdalene in a dramatic one nine th century popular image of <UNK> painted by ary <UNK> further attestation of mary of <UNK> and her role among some early christians is provided by the gnostic apocryphal gospel of mary magdalene which survives in two three rd century greek fragments and a longer five th century translation into coptic in the gospel the testimony of a woman first needed to be defended all of these manuscripts were first discovered and published between one nine three eight and one nine eight three but as early as the three rd century there are patristic references to the gospel of mary these writings reveal the degree to which the gospel was despised and dismissed by the early church fathers in the fragmentary text the disciples ask questions of the risen savior a designation that dates the original no earlier than the two nd century and are answered then they <UNK> saying how shall we go to the gentiles and preach the gospel of the kingdom of the son of man if even he was not spared how shall we be spared and mary magdalene bids them take heart let us rather praise his greatness for he prepared us and made us into men she then delivers at peter s request a vision of the savior she has had and reports her discourse with him which shows gnostic influences her vision does not meet with universal approval but andrew answered and said to the brethren say what you think concerning what she said for i do not believe that the savior said this for certainly these teachings are of other ideas peter also opposed her in regard to these matters and asked them about the savior did he then speak secretly with a woman in preference to us and not openly are we to turn back and all listen to her did he prefer her to us dr karen king a professor of church history at harvard divinity school has observed the confrontation of mary with peter a scenario also found in the gospel of thomas <UNK> sophia and the gospel of the egyptians reflects some of the tensions in second century christianity peter and

mary gospel of mary english syncretic text incorporating coptic and earlier greek versions further web links assertions about mary magdalene the penitent mary magdalene by francesco <UNK> some modern writers have come up with speculative claims that mary magdalene was the wife of jesus these writers cite non canonical and gnostic writings to support their argument sources like the gospel of philip do depict mary magdalene as being closer to jesus than any other disciple however there is no ancient document which claims she was his wife and gnosticism was generally non supportive of sexuality the closeness described in these writings depicts mary magdalene representing the gnostics as understanding jesus and his teaching while the other disciples representing the church did not mary magdalene appears with more frequency than other women in the canonical gospels and is shown as being a close follower of jesus mary s presence at the crucifixion and jesus s tomb while hardly conclusive is at least consonant with the role of grieving wife and widow although if that were the case jesus might have been expected to make provision for her care as well as for his mother mary given the lack of contemporary documentation this scenario cannot be proven and although some consider the idea desirable to believe most scholars do not take it seriously on the other hand there is no direct evidence that jesus was unmarried either an argument for support of the married status of jesus is that <UNK> was very rare for jewish males of jesus time being generally regarded as a transgression of the first mitzvah divine commandment be fruitful and multiply according to this reasoning it would have been unthinkable for an adult unmarried jew to travel about teaching as a rabbi a counter argument to this is that the judaism of jesus time was very diverse and the role of the rabbi was not yet well defined it was really not until after the roman destruction of the second temple in a d seven zero that rabbinic judaism became dominant and the role of the rabbi made uniform in jewish communities before jesus celibate teachers were known in the communities of the essenes and john the baptist also was celibate later paul of tarsus was an example of an unmarried itinerant teacher among christians jesus himself approved of voluntary celibacy for religious reasons and explicitly rejected a duty to marry there are <UNK> who have made themselves <UNK> for the kingdom of heaven he that can take let him take it matt one nine one two the idea that mary magdalene was the wife of jesus was popularized by books like the pseudo historical holy blood holy grail one nine eight two and the da vinci code two zero zero three a novel heavily influenced by the former book these have found no acceptance from scholarly circles multiple books have been written debunking parts of the da vinci code such as the truth behind the da vinci code two zero zero four written by richard <UNK> and the da vinci fraud by robert m price two zero zero five of the jesus seminar the australian scholar barbara <UNK> claims that a full account of the marriage and children of jesus and mary magdalene can be derived from the new testament by use of the <UNK> technique however both her method and her findings have found little support from mainstream scholars metaphysical marriage writers employing metaphysical analogy and allegory assert that christ was already married to the church this image goes back to old testament depictions of the covenant between god and his people as a marriage especially in the books hosea ezekiel and the song of songs imagery of marriage also appears in the gospels and is applied to jesus in the apocalypse of john in the new testament this was later expanded by the church fathers some writers following an early tradition that jesus is in a mystical sense the second adam that began with paul and continued with irenaeus and others embody this sense with literal parallels like the first adam his bride was taken from his side when he had fallen asleep died on the cross in medieval christian <UNK> exegesis the blood and water which came from his side when he was pierced was held to represent the bringing forth of the church with its analogy in the water of baptism and the wine of the new covenant thus christ can be said in an allegorical sense to already have a wife in the church by shifting from the metaphysical analogy to a literal marriage it can then be considered impossible or intolerable to believe that he was literally married

skeptics have argued notably in the march april two zero zero two issue of the magazine skeptical inquirer that the most likely explanation of the sightings is excited eyewitnesses <UNK> a barn owl some have argued that the most likely candidate however is the great horned owl since west virginia is home to the biggest variety of great horned owls in the world this secretive nocturnal bird can walk upright on the ground which gives it an uncanny resemblance to a child sized gray fuzzy creature with wings that spread to up to five feet wide the great grey owl a rare winter visitor to the lower forty eight states is even larger than the great horned owl and could possibly have been the figure behind some of the <UNK> sightings another possibility is the <UNK> of tall gray <UNK> crane seeing either a <UNK> crane or a great grey owl in west virginia would be a rare but by no means impossible experience while it is plausible that some witnesses might have <UNK> a large bird this

if the <UNK> was not performed in total unison this was regarded as an bad omen for the battle often warriors went naked into battle apart from a <UNK> flax belt around the waist the aim of the

employed were similar to those used in other parts of polynesia see buck one nine seven four two nine six cited in references below it is thought that in traditional society many or most high ranking persons were tattooed and those who went without tattoos were seen as persons of lower social status although simmons one nine nine seven cited below contains references throughout to servants who were tattooed with patterns that signalled that they were the slave of a high ranking chief the receiving of tattoos constituted an important milestone on a person s journey to maturity and was accompanied by many rites and rituals according to simmons in both men and women the patterns used were highly significant of a person s rank skills knowledge personal life history tribal affiliations and genealogy in contrast buck one nine seven four two nine eight thought that because t <UNK> experts travelled widely to carry out their art the designs would have related more to the tribal affiliations of the <UNK> rather than those of the tattooed apart from signalling status and rank another reason for the practice in traditional times was to make a person more attractive to the opposite sex the instrument used to tattoo in former times up to one nine two five was a bone chisel with an extremely sharp edge the first stage of the tattoo started with the carving of deep grooves into the skin see simmons one nine nine seven one nine next the chisel was dipped into a sooty pigment such as burnt <UNK> gum which was then <UNK> into the skin it was an extremely long and painful process and often leaves from the <UNK> tree were placed over the swollen <UNK> to hasten the healing process women were not as extensively tattooed with some exceptions only their lips and chin were decorated simmons also mentions that the use of the painful traditional <UNK> implements began to be abandoned in favour of grouped metal needles starting from about one nine one zero ibid in recent years there has been a resurgence in the practice of <UNK> for both men and women as a sign of cultural identity and a reflection of the general revival of the language and culture members of <UNK> <UNK> concert parties often apply temporary markings to their faces to give an approximation of a tattooed appearance interactions with europeans european colonisation of new zealand occurred relatively recently causing the late new zealand historian michael king to state in his book the penguin history of new zealand that m ori were the last major human community on earth untouched and unaffected by the wider world the early european explorers including abel tasman and james cook reported encounters with m ori these early reports described the m ori as a fierce and proud warrior race inter tribal warfare was a way of life with the conquered being enslaved or in some cases eaten from as early as the one seven eight zero s m ori had encounters with european <UNK> and whalers some even crewed on their ships there was also a continuous <UNK> of escaped convicts from australia and <UNK> from visiting ships by one eight three zero it was estimated that there were as many as

learned the language and recorded much of the mythology during this period the acquisition of muskets by those tribes in close contact with european visitors <UNK> the existing balance of power between m ori tribes and there was a period of bloody inter tribal warfare known as the musket wars during which several tribes were effectively exterminated and others were driven from their traditional territory european diseases also killed a large but unknown number of m ori during this period estimates vary between ten and fifty percent with increasing european missionary activity and settlement in the one eight three zero s as well as perceived european lawlessness the british crown as a predominant world power came under pressure to intervene ultimately this led to william <UNK> being dispatched with instructions to take possession of new zealand before he arrived queen victoria annexed new zealand by royal proclamation in january one eight four zero on arrival in february <UNK> negotiated the treaty of <UNK> with the surrounding northern chiefs this treaty was subsequently signed by many other m ori chiefs though by no means all the treaty made the m ori british subjects in return for a guarantee of property rights and tribal autonomy in the one eight six zero s disputes over questionable land purchases and the attempts of m ori in the waikato to establish a rival british style system of royalty led to the new zealand wars although these resulted in relatively few deaths large tracts of tribal land were confiscated by the colonial government settlements such as <UNK> in <UNK> are remembered as sites of violent conflict that took place there during that period revival with the loss of much of their land m ori went into a period of decline and by the late one nine th century it was believed that the m ori population would cease to exist as a separate race and be assimilated into the european population the predicted decline did not occur and population levels recovered despite a high degree of <UNK> between the m ori and european populations m ori were able to retain their cultural identity and in the one nine six zero s and one nine seven zero s m <UNK> underwent a cultural revival no m ori live a traditional pre european contact lifestyle today some commentators express frustration with the theme <UNK> of m ori identity with tourist driven performances and gift shop art others seek to develop a new zealand identity that incorporates strands of m ori identity sympathetic governments and political activism have led to compensation for certain historic instances of unjust confiscation of land and the violation of other property rights a special court the <UNK> tribunal was established to investigate and make recommendations on such issues as a result of the compensation paid m ori now have significant interests in the fishing and forestry industries in many areas of new zealand m ori language ceased to be

islam malcolm with elijah muhammad at savior s day in one nine five two after his release from prison malcolm went to meet elijah muhammad in chicago malcolm wasn t allowed to receive his x yet because he simply hadn t had enough insight study and understanding of the nation the x is meant to symbolize the rejection of his slave name and the absence of an african name the x is also both a reference to the name given to the slaves by the anglo european slave owners unwilling to learn their african names and is also the brand that many slaves received on their upper arm in march of one nine five three the fbi opened a file on malcolm supposedly in response to an allegation that he had described himself as a communist according to the church committee the fbi had long been used to monitor disrupt and <UNK> radicals like malcolm included in the file were two letters wherein malcolm uses the alias malachi <UNK> in message to the black man in america elijah muhammad explained the name <UNK> as belonging to descendants of an asian black nation in may of one nine five three the federal bureau of investigation concluded that malcolm x had an <UNK> personality with paranoid trends

summer of one nine six three tension in the nation of islam reached a boiling point malcolm believed that elijah muhammad was jealous of his popularity as were several senior ministers malcolm watched the march on washington critically unable to understand why black people were excited over a demonstration run by whites in front of a statue of a president who has been dead for a hundred years and who didn t like us when he was alive later in the year following the john f kennedy assassination malcolm delivered a speech as he regularly would however when asked to comment upon the assassination

are over one million mennonites worldwide as of two zero zero six mennonite congregations worldwide embody the full scope of mennonite practice from old fashioned plain people to those who appear no different in dress from other people the largest population of mennonites is in the united states but mennonites <UNK> in tight knit communities in many other countries as well mennonites are prominent among denominations in disaster relief often being the first to arrive with aid after hurricanes floods and other disasters in the last few decades they have also become more actively involved with peace and social justice issues helping to found christian peacemaker teams mennonite conciliation service and the mennonite central committee history background ulrich zwingli from before the middle ages to the early one five th century most christianity in western europe was known alternately as the universal or catholic church headed by the pope every infant born in europe was baptized the catholic church was of paramount importance to the daily life of the average person church services were conducted in latin which was the ecclesiastical language of the time because many common people were illiterate the church <UNK> to instruct its members in the christian faith by means of artwork in church buildings statues paintings and stained glass windows when the printing press was invented around one four five five the bible was one of the first books printed and mass produced with movable type although illiteracy was still widespread more people could now read the bible and interpret it for themselves a factor leading to the protestant reformation in europe key reformers martin luther and john calvin broke with the catholic church each forming a new state church in zurich switzerland ulrich zwingli also left the priesthood to lead the reformation among the swiss cantons radical reformation and the anabaptists some of the followers of zwingli s reformed church felt that requiring church membership beginning at birth was inconsistent with the new testament example they felt that the church should be completely removed from government the proto free church tradition and that people should join only once they were willing to publicly acknowledge that they believed in jesus and wanted to live as he commanded at this time two groups who believed this were the hutterites and another group that would come to be known as mennonites however in the spirit of the times many other more radical groups followed preaching any number of ideas about hierarchy the state and various ideas on sexual license running from utter abandon to extreme chastity these movements have been called by historians the radical reformation modern day mennonites in addition to the amish and hutterites are the direct descendants of the radical reformation anabaptists many do not consider themselves to be protestants nor roman catholic but rather a separate radical reformation the protestant churches considered this radical idea of voluntary church membership to be dangerous they joined forces to fight the movement laws were passed and many people were persecuted robbed of everything they had driven from their homes and countries and martyred however some survived and at a small meeting of believers on january two one one five two five conrad <UNK> felix <UNK> and george <UNK> along with twelve other believers all baptized each other this meeting became the birthplace of the anabaptists or re <UNK> as the movement spread slowly around europe primarily along the rhine river despite the best efforts of the state churches many of the earliest anabaptist leaders those whose beliefs were strongest and who were the most educated were killed in an effort to purge europe of this dangerous idea by one five three zero most of the leaders had been martyred or killed for refusing to renounce their beliefs their unwillingness to fight for their lives was a direct reflection of their belief that god did not <UNK> killing or use of force for any reason and played a large part in the evolution of anabaptist theology when the most educated leaders of the movement were killed they were sometimes replaced by people who did not fully understand their predecessors philosophy and who felt that they had to fight to protect their lives and beliefs these branches were eventually destroyed by their very willingness to fight at the same time the branches that refused to engage the stronger enemy of the state churches still continued to be persecuted robbed of their possessions and forcefully moved but they survived and some became the forerunners of the modern mennonite church fragmentation and variation during the sixteenth century the mennonites and other anabaptists were relentlessly persecuted by the seventeenth century some of them joined the state church in switzerland and persuaded the authorities to <UNK> in their attacks the mennonites outside the state church were divided on whether to remain in communion with their brothers within the state church and this led to a split those against remaining in communion with them became known as the amish after their founder jacob amman those who remained in communion with them retained the name mennonite this period of persecution has had a significant impact on mennonite identity martyrs mirror published in one six six zero documents much of the persecution of anabaptists and their predecessors today the book is still the most important book besides the bible for many mennonites and amish in particular for the swiss south german branch of <UNK> other disagreements over the years have led to other splits sometimes the reasons were theological sometimes practical sometimes geographical for instance near the beginning of the twentieth century there were some members in the amish church who wanted to begin having sunday schools and <UNK> unable to persuade the rest of the amish they separated and formed the conservative mennonite conference mennonites in canada and other countries typically have independent denominations due to the practical considerations of distance and in some cases language menno simons menno simons in the early days of the anabaptist movement menno simons a catholic priest in the netherlands heard of the movement and started to <UNK> his catholic faith he questioned the doctrine of transubstantiation but was reluctant to leave the roman catholic church his thinking was influenced by the death of his brother who as a member of an anabaptist group was killed when he and his companions were attacked and refused to defend themselves in one five three six at the age of four zero simons left the roman catholic church soon thereafter he became a leader within the anabaptist movement he would become a hunted man with a price on his head for the rest of his life his name became associated with scattered groups of nonviolent anabaptists he helped to organize and consolidate persecution welcoming monarchs and early america the first recorded account of this group is in a written order by countess anne who ruled a small province in central europe the presence of some small groups of violent anabaptists was causing political and religious turmoil in her state so she decreed that all anabaptists were to be driven from her state the order made an exception though for the non violent branch known at that time as the <UNK> this order set the precedent that was to be repeated many times throughout history where a political ruler would allow the <UNK> or mennonites into his her state because they were honest <UNK> and peaceful however inevitably their presence would <UNK> the feathers of the powerful state churches or a new monarch would take power and the mennonites would once again be forced to flee for their lives usually leaving everything but their families behind often another monarch in another state would grant them welcome at least for a while an example was the ruling queen of england elizabeth i there in a small village in britain a group of dutch anabaptists made the acquaintance of a congregation led by john <UNK> who would later lead his pilgrims to the netherlands and then to the america the pilgrims exposure to the dutch mennonite congregation probably influenced some of their teachings including the freedom of each branch to regulate itself although the pilgrims known today as the congregational church kept their practice of infant baptism despite the mennonites belief that baptism should take place only once the person had the capacity and willingness to accept jesus as their lord and savior in addition to the mennonites impact on the first american pilgrims religious historians have traced their impact to other religious teachings this included the baptist s emphasis of adult baptism upon confession of faith and the religious society of friends quakers strong stance against war the dissemination of anabaptist beliefs helped build the religious freedom that is enjoyed in america today the netherlands origins of community and simplicity while mennonites in colonial america were enjoying a large degree of religious freedom their counterparts in europe were in largely the same situation they always had been their well being still depended on a ruling monarch who would often extend an invitation only when there was poor soil that no one else could farm the exception to this rule being in the netherlands where the mennonites enjoyed a relatively high degree of tolerance the mennonites would reclaim this land through hard work and good sense in exchange for exemption from mandatory military service however once the land was arable again this arrangement would often change and the persecution would again set in because the land still needed to be tended the ruler would not drive the mennonites out but would actually pass laws to force them to stay while at the same time severely limiting their freedom mennonites had to build their churches facing onto back streets or <UNK> which began the habit of meeting in someone s home rather than a formal church and they were forbidden from announcing the beginning of services with the sound of a bell in addition high taxes were enacted in exchange for both continuing the military service exemption and to keep the states best farmers from leaving usually however in the tradition established by the earliest martyrs the mennonites were willing to pay any price rather than give up their freedom of conscience in some cases the entire congregation would give up their belongings to pay the tax to be allowed to leave if one member of the group or one family couldn t afford the tax the other members of the group happily paid that burden this strong sense of community remains to this day one of the strongest ties that binds mennonites together as a community in addition by having to often give up every earthly possession in order to retain individual freedoms the mennonites learned to live very simply this was reflected both in the home and at church where not only dress but the buildings themselves were very plain even the music at church which was usually simple german chorales were performed with no more elaborate instrument than the human voice jacob amman and the amish mennonites suffered the first church split while still in an area between france and germany known as alsace in one six nine three jacob amman led an effort to reform the mennonite church to include a stronger ban to have communion more often and other differences when the discussions fell through jacob and his followers left the mennonite church to form the amish church though the difference was originally theological the many plain sects that are lumped together as the amish church have come to be recognized for the practice of accepting technology selectively for instance many sects accept battery powered <UNK> but strictly limit wired telephones and power line electricity in order to comply with the demands of romans one two two and be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that ye may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god though the plain sects in southeast pennsylvania are sometimes referred to as the pennsylvania dutch that term actually encompasses a much larger cultural linguistic group than just the amish including mennonites and non plain german reformed church groups as well as they do not <UNK> amish are almost always part of the larger pennsylvania german ethnic group that emigrated to pennsylvania in the one seven two zero s and three zero s even though the first permanent mennonite settlement in america was actually formed in one six eight three and called <UNK> some few are of swiss welsh french english and scottish ancestry old order mennonites some mennonite communities <UNK> reject the use of modern technology such as electricity or motor transport much the same as the amish denominations to whom they are related such mennonites are often referred to as old order mennonites although the term strictly refers to a particular church within that group in order to distinguish them from mennonite denominations that fully accept modern inventions they also reject modern notions of insurance preferring to rely on their neighbors when disaster strikes old order mennonites have a distinctive form of dress which they call plain often looking rather like central european countrymen in addition to old order mennonites throughout the united states and canada there are many groups of conservative mennonites whose practice of new testament teachings makes them distinct from the larger western culture many of these groups withdrew from mainstream mennonite groups during the one nine six zero s and one nine seven zero s during that time mainstream groups were abandoning traditional mennonite practices such as the <UNK> <UNK> for women modesty and simplicity in dress ordination from the laity and <UNK> in government in the years since the groups that have held to a literal interpretation of biblical mennonite practices such as the <UNK> <UNK> have actually increased at a much more rapid rate than those groups that have rejected these standards the russian mennonites catherine the great of russia who acquired a great deal of land north of the black sea in the present day ukraine in one seven six eight following a war with the turks invited those mennonites living in prussia to come farm the cold tough soil of the russian steppes in exchange for religious freedom and military exemption the arrangement remained in place for many years during her rule until she died and the next monarch came to power the mennonites that had settled in russia during that time have come to be known to history as the russian mennonites avoiding the <UNK> of the outside world remains another important keystone in the foundation of the mennonite faith however as with all groups <UNK> is virtually impossible to keep out in the mennonite colonies of russia the mennonites grew financially prosperous in sharp contrast to the ex serfs around them industrial operations were started and grew farms grew large and successful with prosperity came a certain amount of <UNK> including reported fondness for alcohol and greed although by no means accepted by all these habits created strife within communities especially when leadership was unwilling to ask for changes in behaviour occasionally <UNK> movements often influenced by baptist missionaries from germany formed groups opposed to the accepted community ways one particular group formed was the mennonite brethren who left to form their own colonies eventually after many years of prosperity the colonies of russian mennonites were torn apart by war famine disease and finally mass expulsions under the soviet union the state of kansas owes its reputation as a wheat producing state to its early mennonite settlers as a result of their time on the russian steppes under catherine the great they were familiar with a strain of wheat known as winter wheat that was resistant to the cold of the american plains it was planted in the fall and harvested in the following summer and was therefore ideally suited to hot dry kansas summers they brought it with them when the railroads were seeking farmers for the land owned on either side of the tracks and today kansas is a top producer of wheat in america swiss <UNK> mennonites settled in the <UNK> kansas and pretty prairie kansas areas the swiss mennonite cultural and historical association tells their story mennonites of dutch prussian low german descent settled much of south central kansas one of the largest churches with low german roots is the <UNK> mennonite church in <UNK> kansas after one eight seven zero many russian mennonites fearing state influence on their education systems emigrated to the plains states of the us and the western provinces of canada they brought with them many of their institutions and practices including separate denominations heretofore unseen in north america like the mennonite brethren the largest group of russian mennonites came out of russia after the bloody strife following the various russian revolutions and the aftermath of wwi these people having lost everything they had known found their way to settlements in alberta saskatchewan manitoba british columbia and ontario and in many regions of the united states some joined with previous mennonite groups while others formed their own from there many groups fearing state persecution and searching for a way to live quietly on the land have left to form groups in paraguay belize and mexico beginning in the one nine two zero s old colony mennonites went from mexico and belize in the early one nine seven zero s and to argentina in one nine eight six a smaller number of russian mennonites emigrated as refugees along with the retreating german army after the failed german campaign of world war ii mennonites in early american history one of the first groups of mennonites to migrate to the american colonies consisted of thirteen families of dutch extraction who arrived from <UNK> germany in one six eight three and settled in <UNK> pennsylvania among these early settlers was william <UNK> a lay minister and owner of the first american paper mill in the one eight th century one zero zero zero zero zero germans from the palatinate collectively known as the pennsylvania dutch immigrated to pennsylvania of these around two five zero zero were mennonites and five zero zero amish this group settled farther west than the first group choosing less expensive land in the lancaster pennsylvania area a member of this second group christopher dock authored pedagogy the first american monograph on education during the colonial period mennonites were distinguished from other <UNK> germans in three ways their opposition to the revolutionary war resistance to public education and disapproval of religious <UNK> contributions of mennonites during this period include the idea of separation of church and state and opposition to slavery when william penn was settling pennsylvania he visited mennonite settlements in europe offering full religious freedom and exemption from military service mennonites that came to pennsylvania objected to the practice of american quakers who owned slaves the first written protest against slavery in america though often credited to the friends was signed mostly by german mennonites who had become quakers retaining their anti slavery beliefs the treatise was addressed to american quakers in an effort to change their ways from one eight one two to one eight six zero another wave of immigrants settled farther west in ohio indiana illinois and missouri these swiss speaking mennonites along with amish came from switzerland and the alsace lorraine area <UNK> and the general conference one of the more recent branches was initiated involuntarily by john h <UNK> in the mid one eight zero zero s he believed strongly in the right of each congregation to regulate itself and felt that many of the church leaders were trying to gain too much control over the individual congregations they were mandating issues as small as style of dress and splitting when such trivial issues couldn t be agreed upon in his effort to reunite the church under a general conference he gained support of numerous congregations and pastors but not the entire church the result was that the congregations who supported <UNK> s idea came to be known as the general conference mennonite church organized in one eight six zero one of the general conference s greatest contributions was the idea that if a person didn t agree with the leadership of his particular congregation he was allowed simply to change membership to another without embarrassment or scandal of any kind this idea along with many others unique to the general conference mennonites made membership more attractive to newer european and russian mennonites who tended to join the general conference rather than the old mennonites the other major outgrowth of the general conference mennonites was to fulfill john <UNK> s passion of working together in outreach and mission he felt that with all the mennonite churches working together they could accomplish great things in mission even though he failed to unite all churches under this cause the general conference supported more service including more missionaries to various parts of the world in the years since the formation of the general conference several service organizations were created which drew on support from several mennonite denominations these included the mennonite central committee mcc founded in one nine two zero and voluntary service vs programs sponsored by the mennonite board of missions as well as mennonite mutual aid world war ii mennonites in canada were automatically exempt from any type of service during world war i by provisions of the order in council of one eight seven three during world war ii mennonite conscientious objectors were given the options of <UNK> military service serving in the medical or dental corps under military control or working in parks and on roads under civilian supervision over nine five chose the latter and were placed in alternative service camps initially the men worked on road building forestry and firefighting projects after may one nine four three as the labor <UNK> developed within the nation men were shifted into agriculture education and industry the one zero seven zero zero canadian objectors were mostly mennonites six three and <UNK> two zero mennonite conscientious objector harry <UNK> distributes rat poison for typhus control in <UNK> mississippi in the united states civilian public service cps provided an alternative to military service during world war ii from one nine four one to one nine four seven four six six five mennonites amish and brethren in christ were among nearly one two zero zero zero conscientious objectors who performed work of national importance in one five two cps camps throughout the united states and puerto rico the draftees worked in areas such as soil conservation forestry fire fighting agriculture social services and mental health the cps men served without wages and minimal support from the federal government the cost of maintaining the cps camps and providing for the needs of the men was the responsibility of their congregations and families mennonite central committee coordinated the operation of the mennonite camps cps men served longer than regular draftees not being released until well past the end of the war initially skeptical of the program government agencies learned to appreciate the men s service and requested more workers from the program cps made significant contributions to forest fire prevention erosion and flood control medical science and reform of the mental health system population distribution growth and organization according to mennonite church usa sources there were about one two million mennonites worldwide in two zero zero three north america had the highest number of mennonites about four four four zero zero zero closely followed by africa with about four zero six zero zero zero members the third largest concentration of mennonites was in the asia pacific region with about one eight four zero zero zero members while the fourth largest region was south central america and the caribbean with about one one two zero zero zero members europe the birthplace of mennonites fell a distant last with about five eight zero zero zero members with the fastest growth rate by far africa seems poised to overtake north america within the decade as the continent with the largest number of mennonites growth in mennonite membership is slow but steady in north america the asia pacific region and the south central america and caribbean region europe has seen a slow and accelerating decline in mennonite membership since about one nine eight zero there is no single authorized organization that includes all mennonite denominations worldwide instead the majority of mennonite denominations are entirely autonomous these include groups of old order mennonite churches the orthodox church of god in christ mennonite along with other conservative or plain mennonite churches worldwide there are also many mainstream and progressive mennonites who worship in autonomous churches worldwide because of the wide scope of mennonite worship from rigid orthodox to tolerant progressive that occurs among these groups it is difficult to classify these mennonites other than as the autonomous majority of mennonites in the united states and worldwide a minority of mennonite denominations belong to governing groups called churches the larger of these groups are the mennonite brethren a worldwide church and the mennonite church divided into mennonite church usa and mennonite church canada the churches are typically divided into conferences along geographical lines the mennonite brethren have conferences in india africa japan the united states and japan along with independent congregations in germany the mennonite church usa consists of around twenty regional conferences in the united states and canada the mennonite world conference is a community of anabaptist related churches it exists to facilitate community between anabaptist related churches worldwide and relate to other christian world communions and organizations but it is not a governing body of any kind it facilitates community between all willing amish mennonites and hutterites and relates them to the wider world in the united states in two zero zero three the majority estimated from two zero zero zero statistics of mennonites were members in independent denominations outside of the mennonite church usa organization these independent denominations were lumped together as other groups in the mennonite church usa statistics so no sound distinctions between orthodox mainstream progressive mennonite denominations is possible here the total membership in mennonite church usa denominations decreased from about one three three zero zero zero in one nine nine eight before the merger to about one one four zero zero zero in two zero zero three a distinct minority of the three two zero zero zero zero plus mennonites in the united states theology mennonite theology emphasizes the primacy of the teachings of jesus as recorded in new testament scripture they hold in common the ideal of a religious community based on new testament models and imbued with the spirit of the sermon on the mount their core beliefs deriving from anabaptist traditions are the authority of scripture and the holy spirit salvation through conversion by the spirit of god believer s baptism understood as threefold baptism by the spirit internal change of heart baptism by water public demonstration of witness and baptism by blood martyrdom and asceticism or the practice of strict self denial as a measure of personal and especially spiritual discipline <UNK> understood as an outward sign of an inward change discipline in the church informed by new testament teaching particularly of jesus for example matthew one eight one five one eight some mennonite churches practice the ban shunning the lord s supper understood as a memorial rather than as a sacrament or christian rite ideally shared by baptized believers within the unity and discipline of the church one of the earliest expressions of their faith was the <UNK> confession adopted in one five two seven zero two two four its seven articles covered believer s

this system was called the community method or <UNK> since international institutions not directly controlled by the governments wielded a lot of power and members could have decisions they disagreed

these areas were too sensitive to be managed by the mechanisms of the european community and that the power of governments in relation to these areas had to be stronger than the powers of governments in the european community that is an intergovernmental as opposed to supranational system would have to be used other member states feared that this might threaten the power of the independent supranational institutions the european commission european court of justice and european parliament in relation to the economic matters then dealt with by the european community the three pillar

varied choral musical compositions the name comes either from the latin <UNK> to move or a latinized version of old french mot word or verbal utterance the mediaeval latin for motet is <UNK> if from the latin the name describes the movement of the different voices against one another according to margaret bent one nine nine seven a piece of music in several parts with words is as precise a definition of the motet as will serve from the thirteenth to the late sixteenth century and beyond this is actually very close to one of the earliest descriptions we have that of the late thirteenth century theorist johannes de <UNK> <UNK> was also one of the first scholars to define a motet <UNK> believed that the motet was not intended for the vulgar who do not understand its finer points and derive no pleasure from hearing it it is meant for educated people and those who look for refinement in art medieval motets the earliest motets arose in the thirteenth century bent one nine nine seven out of the organum tradition exemplified in the notre dame school of l <UNK> and p <UNK> the motet arose from <UNK> <UNK> sections usually <UNK> interludes in a longer sequence of organum to which upper voices were added usually the <UNK> represented a <UNK> sequence in latin which was sung as a <UNK> over a <UNK> <UNK> which typically was a gregorian chant fragment with different words from the <UNK> the motet took a definite rhythm from the words of the verse and as such appeared as a brief rhythmic interlude in the middle of the longer more <UNK> organum the practice of <UNK> over a <UNK> <UNK> marked the beginnings of counterpoint in western music from these first motets arose a medieval tradition of secular motets these were two or three part compositions in which several different texts sometimes in different vernacular languages were sung simultaneously over a latin <UNK> <UNK> that once again was usually adapted from a passage of gregorian chant it is suspected that for the sake of intelligibility in performance the <UNK> <UNK> and one or another of the vocal lines were performed on instruments increasingly in the one four th and one five th centuries motets tended to be <UNK> that is they employed repeated rhythmic patterns in all voices not just the <UNK> <UNK> which did not necessarily coincide with repeating melodic patterns philippe de <UNK> was one of the earliest composers to use this technique and his work evidently had an influence on that of guillaume de <UNK> one of the most famous named composers of late medieval motets renaissance motets the name of the motet was preserved in the transition from medieval to renaissance music but the character of the composition was entirely changed while it grew out of the medieval <UNK> motet the renaissance composers of the motet generally abandoned the use of a repeated figure as a <UNK> <UNK> guillaume <UNK> was a transitional figure he wrote one of the last motets in the medieval <UNK> style the <UNK> <UNK> flores which premiered in one four three six and was written to commemorate the completion of filippo <UNK> s dome in the cathedral of florence during this time however the use of <UNK> <UNK> in works such as the parody mass tended to stretch the <UNK> <UNK> out to great lengths compared to the <UNK> <UNK> above it this tended to obscure the rhythm supplied by the <UNK> <UNK> that is apparent in the medieval <UNK> motet the cascading passing chords created by the interplay between multiple voices and the absence of a strong or obvious beat are the features that distinguish medieval and renaissance vocal styles instead the renaissance motet is a short polyphonic musical setting in imitative counterpoint for chorus of a religious text not specifically connected to the liturgy of a given day and therefore suitable for use in any service the texts of <UNK> were frequently used as motet texts this is the sort of composition that is most <UNK> named by the name of motet and the renaissance period marked the flowering of the form in essence these motets were sacred madrigals the relationship between the two forms is most obvious in the composers who concentrated on sacred music especially giovanni <UNK> da palestrina whose motets setting texts from the <UNK> <UNK> the biblical song of solomon are among the most lush and <UNK> like of palestrina s compositions while his madrigals that set poems of petrarch in praise of the blessed virgin mary would not be out of place in church the language of the text was the decisive feature if it s latin it s a motet if the vernacular a <UNK> religious compositions in vernacular languages were often called <UNK> <UNK> spiritual madrigals like most madrigals renaissance motets developed in episodic format with separate phrases of the source text being given independent melodic treatment and contrapuntal development contrapuntal passages often alternate with <UNK> secular motets continued to be written these motets typically set a latin text in praise of a monarch or commemorating some public triumph the themes of courtly love often found in the medieval secular motet were banished from the renaissance motet this was one of the pre eminent forms of renaissance music other important composers of renaissance motets include alexander agricola gilles <UNK> antoine <UNK> william byrd johannes <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> comp re <UNK> des <UNK> john <UNK> antoine de f vin francisco guerrero nicolas <UNK> heinrich isaac pierre de la rue orlando di lasso crist bal de morales jean mouton jacob <UNK> johannes <UNK> giovanni <UNK> da palestrina thomas <UNK> john <UNK> tom s luis de victoria in the latter part of the one six th century giovanni <UNK> and other composers developed a new style the <UNK> motet in which two or more choirs of singers or instruments alternated this style of motet was sometimes called the venetian motet to distinguish it from the netherlands or flemish motet written elsewhere baroque motets the name motet was preserved into baroque music especially in france where the word was applied to <UNK> motets sacred choral compositions whose only accompaniment was a basso continuo and grands motets which included instruments up to and including a full orchestra jean baptiste <UNK> was an important composer of this sort of motet <UNK> s motets often included parts for soloists as well as choirs they were longer including multiple movement in which different soloist choral or instrumental forces were employed <UNK> s motets also continued the renaissance tradition of semi secular latin motets in works such as <UNK> <UNK> gallia written to celebrate the baptism of king louis xiv s son its text by pierre perrin begins <UNK> <UNK> gallia <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> delphinus <UNK> <UNK> et <UNK> christo <UNK> rejoice and sing france the lily is bathed with heavenly dew the dauphin is bathed in the sacred font and the christian is dedicated to christ in

composers of motets included camille saint sa ns and c sar franck similar compositions in the english language are called anthems but some later english composers such as charles villiers stanford

flourished after the arthurian period the earliest welsh poems that concern the <UNK> legend present him as a madman living a <UNK> existence in the caledonian forest <UNK> on his former existence and the disaster that brought him low the death of his lord <UNK> whom he served as bard the allusions in these poems serve to sketch out the events of the battle of <UNK> where <UNK> <UNK> king of <UNK>

called <UNK> although said by some to be called <UNK> or merlin who declares that he has been condemned for his sins to wander in the company of beasts he added that he had been the cause for the deaths of all of the persons killed in the battle fought on the plain between <UNK> and <UNK> having told his story the madman <UNK> up and fled from the presence of the saint back into the wilderness he appears several times more in the narrative until at last asking st <UNK> for the sacrament <UNK> that he was about to die a triple death after some hesitation the saint granted the madman s wish and later that day the shepherds of king <UNK> captured him beat him with clubs then cast him into the river tweed where his body was pierced by a stake thus fulfilling his prophecy welsh literature

<UNK> which looks like a close adaptation of a number of <UNK> poems a scottish example of the legend of merlin comes from five seven seven which was the year of the battle of <UNK> this was a battle between fierce enemies <UNK> the <UNK> king of strathclyde and <UNK> the <UNK> king of <UNK> while few have heard of the main protagonists among aidan s contingent was the celtic bard merlin merlin s patron <UNK> was killed during the battle in which he was awarded for his verses recording the battle merlin ambrosius <UNK> <UNK> it was geoffrey of monmouth who introduced merlin into the myths of king arthur the name <UNK> is altered to merlin to avoid a resemblance to the obscene french word <UNK> meaning excrement while geoffrey is remembered most for his character of arthur it was merlin whom he concentrated on making the prophetic bard a central character of his three books <UNK> <UNK> historiae regum britanniae and vita <UNK> as a result of this second book where merlin appears in the tales of the king vortigern aurelius ambrosius and <UNK> pendragon who reigned immediately before arthur merlin in some later works also became a character in tales of arthur geoffrey tells only two tales of merlin merlin is begotten on a king s daughter by a demon and the episode is now placed at <UNK> in welsh caer <UNK> as a young boy he was already known for his prophetic abilities and was consulted by king vortigern to explain why his castle would collapse every time it was rebuilt he revealed there was an underground lake with two sleeping dragons a white one and red one and explained they respectively represented the saxons and britons and <UNK> for things to come <UNK> had recorded this tale in the historia <UNK> of the nine th century but attached it to aurelius ambrosius rather than merlin geoffrey conflated the two sages and incorporated them into his work simply and <UNK> stating that merlin was also called ambrosius to cover over his changing of <UNK> a long section of prophecy is added at this point the first tale tells how merlin created stonehenge as a burial place for aurelius ambrosius the second tale tells how by shape changing magic merlin enabled <UNK> pendragon to enter into <UNK> in disguise and father his son arthur these episodes also appear in many later adaptations of geoffrey s account somewhat later the poet robert de boron retold this material in his poem merlin with many expansions but with details garbled and changed in a way that suggests that the version of wace who adapted geoffrey s account into anglo norman had entered oral tradition and that this oral tradition was what robert knew along with some other merlin tales only a few lines of the poem have survived but a prose retelling became popular and was later incorporated into two other romances in robert s account merlin is begotten by a devil from hell on a virgin as an intended antichrist but his <UNK> mother advised by her confessor and counsellor blaise who realised what was <UNK> had the boy baptized at birth to foil this satanic plot however being half demon merlin still had tremendous magical powers to know what was happening past and present and god himself gave him prophetic knowledge of the future robert de boron lays great emphasis on merlin s power to change his shape on his joking personality and on his connection to the grail this text introduces merlin s master blaise who is pictured as writing merlin s deeds which merlin dictates to him explaining how they came to be known and preserved it also connects merlin with the holy grail as the arthurian mythos was retold and embellished upon merlin s prophetic aspects were sometimes de emphasized in favor of portraying merlin as a wizard and elder advisor to arthur on the other hand in prose lancelot it is said that merlin was never baptized and never did any good in his life only evil medieval arthurian tales abound in inconsistencies in the prose lancelot and later accounts merlin s eventual downfall came from his <UNK> after a woman named <UNK> who <UNK> his magical secrets from him eventually turning the magic he had taught her against him and imprisoning him either in a cave where he died or in a magical and invisible palace where he may live still this was unfortunate for arthur depriving him of merlin s counsel there are three such accounts of merlin in arthur s day which also cover the early days of arthur s reign the earliest known as the vulgate merlin includes robert de boron s merlin it was intended as a sort of prequel to the three romances of the lancelot grail cycle an incomplete variant version known as the book of arthur also exists the second is sometimes called the <UNK> merlin or the post vulgate suite du merlin it is part of a long prose romance that has not survived intact but which is now known as the book of the grail or the post vulgate cycle intended as an entire history of the grail and of arthur and his knights this also includes robert de boron s merlin the third work is called the prophecies of merlin and contains long prophecies of merlin mostly concerned with thirteenth century italian

commodities that they do not produce themselves in order to produce profit merchants can be categorised into two types a wholesale merchant operates in the chain between producer and retail merchant

atmosphere commonly called a shooting star or falling star for bodies with a size scale larger than the atmospheric mean free path one zero cm to several meters the visibility is due to the heat produced by the ram pressure not friction as is commonly assumed of atmospheric entry since the majority of meteors are from small sand grain size <UNK> bodies most visible signatures are caused by <UNK> following the individual collisions between <UNK> meteor atoms and atmospheric constituents a very bright meteor may be called a fireball or <UNK> the international meteor organisation defines fireballs as being meteors of magnitude three or brighter the meteor section of the british astronomical association on the other hand has a much stricter definition requiring the meteor to be magnitude five or brighter if a <UNK> survives its transit of the atmosphere to come to rest on the surface the resulting object is called a meteorite a meteor striking the earth or other object may produce an impact crater molten terrestrial material <UNK> from such a crater can cool and solidify into an object known as a <UNK> meteor dust particles left by falling <UNK> can persist in the atmosphere for up to several months these particles might affect climate both by scattering electromagnetic radiation and by <UNK> chemical reactions in the upper atmosphere ionization trails during the entry of a <UNK> into the upper atmosphere an ionization trail is created where the molecules in the upper atmosphere are ionized by the passage of the meteor such ionization trails can last up to four five minutes at a time small sand grain sized <UNK> are entering the atmosphere constantly essentially every few seconds in a given region and thus ionization trails can be found in the upper atmosphere more or less continuously when radio waves are bounced off these trails it is called meteor scatter communication meteor scatter has been used for experimental secure military battlefield communications systems the basic idea of such a system is that such an ion trail will act as a mirror for radio waves which can be bounced off the trail security arises from the fact that as a mirror only receivers in the correct position will hear the transmitter much as with a real mirror what is seen in reflection depends upon one s position with respect to the mirror because the sporadic nature of meteor entry such systems are limited to low data rates typically four five nine six zero zero baud amateur radio operators sometimes use meteor scatter communication on vhf bands <UNK>

examination of files about the death of the crown prince revealed major discrepancies between the claimed manner of the deaths and the factual evidence including that rudolf had engaged in a violent

the remaining five bullets remains a mystery while the official statement of how the deaths occurred and its central theory of a double suicide is now discredited it remains unclear whether rudolf in

the piano the keyboard layout is often called the piano keyboard in spite of this keyboard instruments of different types are often played using different techniques in particular the electric

keys are uniformly distributed if the width of an octave is taken to be one two units then the white key width is one two seven units and the centre of each of the twelve keys must be separated by one unit there have been variations in the design of the keyboard to address technical and musical issues for instance during the sixteenth century when instruments were often tuned in meantone temperament some harpsichords were constructed with the g and e keys split into two one portion of the g key operated a string tuned to g and the other operated a string tuned to a similarly one portion of the e key operated a string tuned to e the other portion operating a string tuned to d this extended the flexibility of the harpsichord enabling composers to write keyboard music calling for harmonies containing the so called wolf fifth e to g but without producing discomfort in the listeners other examples of variations in keyboard design include the <UNK> keyboard and the chromatic keyboard systems on the accordion and <UNK> n other instruments share the keyboard layout although they are not keyboard instruments for example the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> all have a separate

systems of tuning for the musical process of tuning see tuning musical tuning is the system used to define which tones or pitches to use when playing music in other words it is the choice of number and spacing of frequency values which are used the tuning systems are usually defined in such a way that a listener perceives it as natural due to the <UNK> properties of tones various pitch combinations will sound more or less natural when used in combination for example a tone caused by a vibration twice the speed of another the ratio of one two forms the natural sounding octave another natural resonance found in musical scales the world over is the ratio of one three two three when octave reduced which is often called a perfect fifth more complex musical effects can be created through other relationships mathieu one nine nine seven building a tuning system is complicated when musicians want to make music with more than just a few differing tones as the number of tones is increased conflicts arise in how each tone combines with every other finding a successful combination of tunings has been the cause of debate and has lead to the creation of many different tuning systems across the world each tuning system has its own characteristics strengths and weaknesses subjects in general musical theory mathematics of musical scales other musical tunings chinese indian etc microtonal music psychoacoustics physics of music midi ways of tuning the twelve note chromatic scale it is impossible to tune the twelve note chromatic scale so that all intervals are perfect many different methods with their own various compromises have thus been put forward the main ones are just intonation in which the ratios of the frequencies between all notes are based on relatively low whole numbers such as three two five four or seven four or in which all pitches are based on the harmonic series music which are all whole number multiples of a single tone such a system may use two different ratios for what is the same interval in equal temperament depending on context for instance a major second may be either in the ratio nine eight or one zero nine for this reason just intonation may be less a suitable system for use on keyboard instruments or other instruments where the pitch of individual notes is not flexible on fretted instruments like guitars and lutes multiple frets for one interval is practical pythagorean tuning in which the ratios of the frequencies between all notes are all multiples of three two the pythagorean system was further developed by <UNK> ad din al <UNK> who divided the octave into seventeen parts <UNK> and commas and used in the turkish and persian tone systems meantone temperament a system of tuning which averages out pairs of ratios used for the same interval such as nine eight and one zero nine thus making it possible to tune keyboard instruments next to the twelve equal temperament which some would not regard as a form of meantone the best known form of this temperament is quarter comma meantone which tunes major thirds justly in the ratio of five four and divides them into two whole tones of equal size to do this eleven perfect fifths in each octave are flattened by a quarter of a <UNK> comma with the remaining fifth being left very sharp such an <UNK> out of tune fifth is known as a wolf interval however the fifth may be flattened to a greater or lesser degree than this and the tuning system will retain the essential qualities of meantone temperament examples include the three one equal fifth and lucy tuning both just intonation and meantone temperament can be regarded as forms of regular temperament well temperament any one of a number of systems where the ratios between intervals are unequal but

typically piano and electric piano stretched tuning is sometimes claimed to give a warmer sound to chords comparisons and controversies between tunings all musical tuning have advantages and disadvantages twelve tone equal temperament is the standard and most usual tuning system used in western music today because it gives the advantage of modulation to any key without dramatically going out of tune as all keys are equally and slightly out of tune however just intonation provides the advantage of being entirely in tune with at least some and possible a great deal loss in ease of modulation referring to one two tet the composer terry riley who has written music for both tuning systems has been quoted as saying western music is fast because it s not in tune twelve tone equal temperament also currently has an advantage over just intonation in that most musicians will have instruments that can only play in equal temperament since these are readily available other tuning systems have other advantages and disadvantages and are chosen for these qualities it must be realized however that just as many people who play music today in equal temperament without having heard of it many musicians throughout the world and the past used just intonation without knowing it the octave or even other intervals such as the so called <UNK> or twelfth can <UNK> be divided into a number of equal steps different from twelve popular choices for such an equal temperament include one nine two two three one five three and seven two parts to an octave each of these and the many other choices possible have their own distinct characteristics non equal and non just tunings also provide advantages for instance william <UNK> shows that the tunings of balinese <UNK> are related to the <UNK> spectra or timbre of their <UNK> and the harmonic spectra of stringed instruments such as the <UNK> just as just intonation and twelve tone equal temperament are related to the spectra or timbre of harmonic instruments alone some instruments such as the violin don t limit the musician to particular pitches allowing to choose the tuning system on the fly many performers on such

to recreate the chemical conditions of the primitive earth in the laboratory and synthesized some of the building blocks of life the miller urey experiment or urey miller experiment was an experiment that simulated hypothetical conditions present on the early earth and tested for the occurrence of chemical evolution the <UNK> and haldane hypothesis stated that conditions on the primitive earth favored chemical reactions that synthesized organic compounds from inorganic precursors the miller urey tested this hypothesis the experiment is considered to be the classic experiment on the origin of life it was conducted in one nine five three by stanley l miller and harold c urey at the university of chicago experiment and interpretation the experiment the experiment used water h two o methane ch four ammonia nh three and hydrogen h two the chemicals were all sealed inside a sterile array of glass tubes and <UNK> connected together in a loop with one flask half full of liquid water and another flask containing a pair of electrodes the liquid water was heated to induce evaporation sparks were fired through the atmosphere and water vapor to simulate lightning and then the atmosphere was cooled again so that the water could condense and <UNK> back into the first flask in a continuous cycle at the end of one week of continuous operation miller and urey observed that as much as one zero one five of the carbon within the system was now in the form of organic compounds two percent of the carbon had formed amino acids including one three of the two one that are used to make proteins in living cells with glycine as the most abundant however there are two forms of amino acids they are referred to as a left handed or a right handed amino acids only left handed amino acids are found in living organisms and the ones created in the miller urey experiment and all subsequent experiments succeed in creating right and left handed amino acids in roughly a five zero five zero ratio the molecules produced were simple organic molecules far from a complete living biochemical system but the experiment established that the hypothetical processes could produce some building blocks of life without requiring life to synthesize them first other experiments this experiment inspired many experiments in a similar vein in one nine six one joan or found that amino acids could be made from hydrogen cyanide <UNK> and ammonia in a water solution he also found that his experiment produced a large amount of the nucleotide base adenine experiments conducted later showed that the other rna and dna bases could be obtained through simulated <UNK> chemistry with a reducing atmosphere earth s early atmosphere there have been a number of objections to the implications derived from these experiments it is now believed that earth s original atmosphere did not contain as large a quantity of reducing molecules as was thought at the time originally it was thought that the primitive secondary atmosphere contained mostly nh three and ch four however it is likely that most of the atmospheric carbon was co two with perhaps some co and the nitrogen mostly n two the reasons for this are a volcanic gas has more co two co and n two than ch four and nh three and b uv radiation destroys nh three and ch four so that these molecules would have been short lived uv light <UNK> h two o to h and oh radicals these then attack methane giving eventually co two and releasing h two which would be lost into space in practice gas mixtures containing co co two n two etc give much the same products as those containing ch four and nh three so long as there is no o two the h atoms come mostly from water vapor in fact in order to generate aromatic amino acids under primitive earth conditions it is necessary to use less hydrogen rich gaseous mixtures most of the natural amino acids <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and sugars have been produced in variants of the miller experiment more recent results may have called this into question however simulations done at the university of waterloo and university of colorado in two zero zero five indicated that the early atmosphere of earth could have contained up to four zero hydrogen implying a much more hospitable environment for the formation of <UNK> organic molecules the escape of hydrogen from earth s atmosphere into space may have occurred at only one of the rate previously believed based on revised estimates of the upper atmosphere s temperature one of the authors prof owen toon notes in this new scenario <UNK> can be produced efficiently in the early atmosphere leading us back to the organic rich soup in the ocean concept i think this study makes the experiments by miller and others relevant again outgassing calculations

although lightning storms are thought to have been very common in the primordial atmosphere they are not thought to have been as common as the amount of electricity used by the miller urey experiment may imply these factors suggest that much lower concentrations of <UNK> would have been produced on earth than was originally predicted although the time scale would be one zero zero million years instead of a week similar experiments both with different sources of energy and with different mixtures of gases have resulted in amino and <UNK> acids being produced it is likely that at least some organic compounds would have been generated on the early earth however as soon as oxygen gas is added to the mixture no organic molecules are formed recent research has been seized upon by opponents of urey miller hypothesis which shows the presence of uranium in sediments dated to three seven ga and indicates it was transported in solution by oxygenated water otherwise it would have precipitated out <UNK> in fact most evidence suggests that <UNK> photosynthesis was present during time periods from which there is evidence for a non <UNK> atmosphere conditions similar to those of the miller urey experiments are present in other regions of the solar system often substituting ultraviolet light for lightning as the driving force for chemical reactions on september two eight one nine six nine the murchison meteorite that fell near murchison victoria australia was found to contain over nine zero different amino acids nineteen of which are found in earth life comets and other icy outer solar system bodies are thought to contain large amounts of complex carbon compounds such as <UNK> formed by these processes in some cases so much so that the surfaces of these bodies are turned dark red or as black as asphalt the early earth was bombarded heavily by comets possibly providing a large supply of complex organic molecules along with the water and other <UNK> they contributed this could also imply an origin of life outside of earth which then migrated here see panspermia recent related studies during recent years studies have been made of the amino acid composition of the products of old areas in old genes defined as those that are found to be common to organisms from several widely separated species assumed to share only the last universal ancestor <UNK> of all extant species these studies found that the products of these areas are enriched in those amino acids that are also most readily produced in the miller urey experiment this suggests that the original genetic

as part of zoroastrianism in the eastern provinces of the empire particularly in asia minor now modern turkey <UNK> is best documented in the form it had acquired in the later roman empire it was an

mithras carrying a rock on his back much as atlas did and or wearing a cape that had the starry sky as its inside lining a bronze image of mithras emerging from an egg shaped zodiac ring found associated with a <UNK> along hadrian s wall now at the university of newcastle and an inscription from the city of rome suggest that mithras may have been seen as the <UNK> creator god <UNK> who emerged from the cosmic egg at the beginning of time bringing the universe into existence this view is reinforced by a bas relief at the <UNK> museum in modena italy which shows <UNK> coming from an egg surrounded by the twelve signs of the zodiac in an image very similar to that at newcastle he is sometimes depicted as a man being born or reborn from a rock the petra <UNK> typically with the snake <UNK> wrapped around it it is commonly believed that the cave in <UNK> imagery represents the cosmos and the rock is the cosmos seen from the outside hence the description of this god as rising from the dead according to some accounts mithras died was buried in a <UNK> rock tomb and was resurrected another more widely accepted interpretation takes its clue from the writer porphyry who recorded that the cave pictured in the <UNK> was intended to be an image of the cosmos according to this view the cave depicted in that image may represent the great cave of the sky this interpretation was supported by research by k b stark in one eight six nine with astronomical support by roger beck one nine eight four and one nine eight eight david <UNK> one nine eight nine and noel <UNK> one nine nine one this interpretation is reinforced by the constant presence in <UNK> imagery of heavenly objects such as stars the moon and the sun and symbols for the signs of the zodiac one of the central motifs of <UNK> is the <UNK> the myth of sacrifice by <UNK> of a sacred bull created by the supreme deity ahura mazda which <UNK> <UNK> to death in the cave having been instructed to do so by a crow sent from ahura mazda in this myth from the body of the dying bull spring plants animals and all the beneficial things of the earth it is thought that the bull represents the constellation of taurus however in the period we are considering the sun at the vernal equinox had left taurus two thousand years before and was in the process of moving from aries to pisces in light of this interpretation it has been suggested in recent times that the <UNK> religion is somehow connected to the end of the astrological age of taurus and the beginning of the age of aries which took place about the year two zero zero zero bc it has even been speculated that the religion may have originated at that time although there is no record of it until the two nd century bc the identification of an age with a particular zodiac constellation is based on the sun s position during the vernal equinox before two zero zero zero bc the sun could have been seen against the stars of the constellation of taurus at the time of vernal equinox had there been an eclipse due to the precession of the equinoxes on average every two one six zero years the sun appears against the stars of a new constellation at vernal equinox the current astrological age started when the equinox <UNK> into the constellation of pisces in about the year one five zero bc with the age of aquarius starting in ad two six zero zero indeed the constellations common in the sky from about four zero zero zero bc to two zero zero zero bc were taurus the bull canis minor the dog hydra the snake corvus the raven and <UNK> the scorpion all of which may be identified in the fresco from marino a standard hellenistic iconography illustration above right further support for this theory is the presence of a lion and a cup in some depictions of the <UNK> indeed leo a lion and aquarius the cup bearer were the constellations seen as the northernmost summer solstice and southernmost winter solstice positions in the sky during the age of taurus the precession of the equinoxes was discovered or at least publicized by the greek astronomer hipparchus in the two nd century bc whether the phenomenon was known by <UNK> previously is unknown in any case mithras was presumed to be very powerful if he was able to rotate the heavens and thus kill the bull or displacing taurus as the reigning image in the heavens some commentators <UNK> that the <UNK> worshipped mithras as the mediator between man and the supreme god of the upper and <UNK> world other commentators inspired by james frazer s theories have additionally labeled mithras a mystery religion with a life death rebirth deity comparable to isis the resurrected jesus or the persephone demeter cult of the eleusinian mysteries history of <UNK>

says by the favor of <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> this palace i built may <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> protect me from all evil and that which i have built may they not <UNK> nor harm it is tempting to identify the roman mithras with the persian <UNK> except that there is no known persian legend or text about <UNK> killing a bull or being associated with other animals on the other hand there is a story of <UNK> the evil god in popular developments of zoroastrianism killing a bull it is easy to explain the sun god <UNK> being worshipped in the <UNK> cave like <UNK> each night the sun was thought to journey through the underworld after sunset from west to east until sunrise a possible link between persia and rome which could be the stage for these changes may be the kingdoms of parthia and pontus in asia minor several of their kings were called <UNK> meaning given by <UNK> starting with <UNK> i of parthia died one three eight bc it would seem that in those kingdoms <UNK> was a god whose power lent luster even to a king and it was at pergamum in the two nd century bc that greek sculptors started to produce bas relief imagery of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the bull slayer although the cult of mithras never caught on in the greek homeland those sculptures may indicate the route between persian <UNK> and roman mithras around the first century ad the greek historian plutarch wrote about pirates of cilicia who practiced the <UNK> secret rites around six seven bc since cilicia was the coastal province in the southeast of anatolia the mithras mentioned by plutarch may have been worship of the persian god

frontiers and dacia the cult of mithras began to attract attention at rome about the end of the first century ad perhaps in connection with the conquest of then zoroastrian armenia the earliest material evidence for the roman worship of mithras dates from that period in a record of roman soldiers who came from the military garrison at <UNK> in the roman province of upper pannonia near the danube river in modern austria near the hungarian border these soldiers fought against the parthians and were involved in the suppression of the revolts in jerusalem from six zero a d to about seven

and ruins of temples and shrines in all parts of the city and its suburbs a well preserved late two nd century <UNK> with its altar and built in stone benches originally built beneath a roman house as was a common practice survives in the crypt over which has been built the basilica of san clemente rome the demise of <UNK> worship of the sun sol did exist within the indigenous roman pantheon as a minor part and always as a pairing with the moon however in the east there were many solar deities including the greek helios who was largely displaced by apollo by the three rd century the popular cults of apollo and mithras had started to merge into the syncretic cult known as sol invictus and in two seven four ce the emperor aurelian whose mother had been a priestess of the sun made worship of sol invictus official subsequently aurelian built a splendid new temple in rome and created a new body of priests to support it pontifex <UNK> <UNK> attributing his victories in the east to sol invictus but none of this affected the existing cult of mithras which remained a non official cult some senators held positions in both cults however this period was also the beginning of the decline of <UNK> as dacia was lost to the empire and invasions of the northern peoples resulted in the destruction of temples along a great stretch of frontier the main stronghold of the cult the spread of christianity through the empire boosted by constantine s tolerance of it from around three one zero ce also took its toll particularly as christianity admitted women while <UNK> did not which obviously limited its potential for rapid growth the reign of julian who attempted to restore the faith and suppress christianity and the <UNK> of eugenius renewed the hopes of its devotees but the decree secured by theodosius in three nine four totally forbidding non christian worship may be considered the end of <UNK> s formal public existence <UNK> still survived in certain cantons of the alps into the five th century and clung to life with more tenacity in its eastern homelands its eventual successor as the carrier of persian religion to the west was manichaeism which competed strenuously with christianity for the status of world religion connections there is much speculation that christian beliefs were influenced by <UNK> belief ernest <UNK> in the origins of christianity promoted the idea that <UNK> was the prime competitor to christianity in the second through the fourth century ad although some scholars feel the written claims that the emperors nero commodus septimius severus caracalla and the <UNK> were initiates are dubious as there is little evidence that <UNK> worship was accorded official status as a roman cult other than its official form as sol invictus the first universal religion of the greco roman world bull and cave themes are found in christian shrines dedicated to the archangel michael who after the legalization of christianity became the patron saint of soldiers many of those shrines were converted <UNK> for instance the sacred cavern at monte <UNK> in apulia refounded in four nine three it is hard to avoid the conclusion that the mithras cult was transferred to the previously <UNK> archangel bull and crypt are linked in the catholic saint <UNK> frequently <UNK> or <UNK> of toulouse france the <UNK> is retained as a crypt under his earliest church <UNK> named notre dame du <UNK> it has also been speculated that the ancient <UNK> of <UNK> the encircling serpent about to bite its own tail was adapted for a christian symbol of the limited confines of time and space the snake around a rock also is <UNK> of the midgard serpent j <UNK> who was said to surround midgard the earth according to norse traditions christians would argue that because the gospels are thought to have been mostly before one zero zero and that since very little is known of roman <UNK> until after one zero zero that it is implausible to say that christianity borrowed its doctrines from <UNK> some christians have suggested that <UNK> may have in fact borrowed elements from christianity other non christian scholars disagree with the conclusions a better determinant of borrowing is to compare core doctrines between christianity and <UNK> the adoption of imagery or icons or festivals is fairly peripheral such as the adoption by christendom of winter solstice or <UNK> festivals as christmas but seldom reflects basic religious tenets a further example of this is the various gnostic cults such as pelagianism which adopted the personage of jesus or the concept of a savior yet did not adopt the underlying doctrinal elements similarities to christianity according to martin a larson in the story of christian origins one nine seven seven <UNK> and christianity derived from the same sources originally from the savior cult of osiris a rarely discussed view among <UNK> and christian scholars but which accounts for the similarities without assuming a christian <UNK> from <UNK> he also believes that the essenes were jewish pythagoreans whose members not only gave birth to christianity as essenes but were directly influenced by

nine six nine he attracted his own following around himself while remey was still alive called the orthodox bah faith donald harvey in one nine six seven remey publically declared that he was choosing donald harvey to be his successor whilst just two years later marangella made his proclamation to being the third guardian asserting that when remey activated the second international bah council he ceased being the guardian at that moment since he claimed there could only be one guardian alive at a time remey never commented on the matter further than stating that according to the will and

justice bah divisions bah individuals hands of the cause of god minimalism describes movements in various forms of art and design especially visual art and music where the work is stripped down to its most fundamental features in other fields of art it has been used to describe the novels of ernest hemingway the plays of samuel beckett the films of robert <UNK> the stories of raymond carver called the king of minimalism and even the automobile designs of colin chapman as a specific movement in the arts it is identified with developments in post world war ii western art most strongly with the visual arts for example the paintings of mark <UNK> the term has expanded to encompass a movement in music which features repetition and iteration for example the music of steve reich philip glass and terry riley see also post minimalism it is rooted in the spare aspects of modernism and is often associated with postmodernism and reaction against expressionism in both painting and composition the term minimalist can also refer to anything which is spare stripped to its essentials or providing only the outline of structure independent of the particular art movement and minimalism the tendency to reduce to fundamentals it is sometimes applied to groups or individuals practicing asceticism and the reduction of physical possessions and needs to a minimum minimalism in visual art one of dan <UNK> s lighting tube installations stack by donald judd a minimalist painting for example will typically use a limited number of colors and have a simple geometric design minimalist sculpture on the other hand is greatly focused on the materials see david smith and donald judd while many believe minimalism to be a movement specific to geometric representations it extends far outside this constraint there were three notable phases of the minimalist movement first the distillation of the forms wherein the greatest contributors were probably the russian <UNK> and the romanian sculptor constantin br <UNK> i the russian <UNK> proclaiming the distillation was in order to create a universal language of art which the masses were meant to understand it may have also supported the rapid industrialization planned for the massive country br <UNK> i s work was much more of a search for the purity of the form and thus paved the way for the abstractions that were to come such as minimalism the second and most notable phase in the movement came with artists including carl andre anne <UNK> dan <UNK> sol <UNK> frank stella donald judd ad reinhardt and robert <UNK> it commenced in one nine six four with the exhibition of dan <UNK> s monument for v <UNK> which was an assembly of neon lighting tubes the tubes had not been modified in any way by the artist merely arranged the assembly did not signify anything other than itself it simply existed these one nine six zero s artists were anti romantic they very explicitly stated that their art was not self expression in complete opposition to the previous decade s abstract <UNK> very soon they created a minimal style whose features included rectangular and cubic forms purged of all metaphor equality of parts repetition neutral surfaces industrial materials all of which leads to immediate visual impact later minimal sculptors included tony smith larry bell and john <UNK> ad reinhardt summed up the style in these terms the more stuff in it the <UNK> the work of art the worse it is more is less less is more the eye is a menace to clear sight the laying bare of oneself is obscene art begins with the getting rid of nature this style was heavily criticised it was called futile mechanistic mandarin elitist circular pedantic and authoritarian some critics thought they were dealing with outright fraud also notable are the post <UNK> including martin <UNK> tyrone <UNK> melvin edwards and joel shapiro the keystone of post minimalism is the often distinct references to objects without direct representation this has become a predominant trend in modern sculpture musical minimalism main article minimalist music the cover of the beatles so called white album in classical music of the last three five years the term minimalism is sometimes applied to music which displays some or all of the following features repetition often of short musical phrases with minimal variations over long periods of time or stasis often in the form of drones and long tones emphasis on consonant harmony a steady pulse minimalist music is sometimes very similar currently to electronic music and composition it should be noted that the minimalist movement in music bears only an occasional relationship to the movement of the same name in visual art this connection is probably one reason why many minimalist composers dislike the term philip glass whose group initially performed at art galleries where his minimalist visual artist friends were showing reportedly said of minimalism that word should be stamped out also the so called white album from the beatles released in one nine six eight can be seen as an part of minimalism in music the songs were very simple just guitar bass and drums but also the cover of the album plain white and in the beginning even without words can be seen as an piece of minimalism many people think this was a reaction to the <UNK> of the year one nine six seven the album came after the very colorful sgt pepper s lonely hearts club band with all it s little sounds and tricks minimalist design the term minimalism is also used to describe a trend in design and architecture wherein the subject is reduced to its necessary elements architect ludwig mies van der rohe adopted the motto to describe his aesthetic tactics of flattening and emphasizing the building s frame eliminating interior walls and adopting an open plan and reducing the structure to a strong transparent elegant skin designer buckminster fuller adopted a similar saying doing more with less but his concerns were more oriented towards technology and engineering than aesthetics contemporary architects working in this tradition include john <UNK> eduardo <UNK> de <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and peter <UNK> literary minimalism literary minimalism is characterized by an economy with words minimalist authors eschew adverbs and prefer allowing context to dictate meaning readers are expected to take an active role in the creation of a story to choose sides based on oblique hints and <UNK> rather than reacting to directions from the author the characters in minimalist stories and novels tend to be <UNK> they re average people who sell pool supplies or coach second tier athletic teams not famous detectives or the <UNK> wealthy generally the short stories are slice of life stories some one nine four zero s era crime fiction of writers such as james m cain and jim thompson adopted a stripped down matter of fact prose style to considerable effect this prose style may be classified as minimalism another strand of literary minimalism arose in response to the meta fiction trend of the one nine six zero s and early one nine seven zero s john barth <UNK> and william h <UNK> these writers were also spare with prose and kept a psychological distance from their subject matter minimalist authors include the following raymond carver chuck <UNK> bret easton ellis amy <UNK> <UNK> ann mason tobias wolff grace paley sandra <UNK> mary <UNK> and frederick <UNK> the irish author samuel beckett is also known for writing <UNK> plays and short stories minimalism in philosophy minimalism in philosophy or <UNK> philosophies indicates a philosophy formed around only a few elements of life as opposed to the full spectrum people practicing <UNK> philosophies often resort to living life with the bare minimum of what is required to survive cults often claim to practice <UNK> philosophies where the leaders <UNK> their followers to abandon things of value in their lives including things as basic as clothes and the right to maintain personal hygiene most modern philosophies could also be considered <UNK> in that they resort to providing only a limited set of valued elements as opposed to everything a person needs to live their life for example a philosophy centered around only money minimalism postmodern art a magneto provides pulses of electrical power to the spark plugs in some petrol powered internal combustion engines where batteries are not available most commonly those in two stroke and four stroke engines used in small motorcycles <UNK> and <UNK> as well as in most small aircraft and some racing automobiles serving a similar function to the coil type ignition system found in automobiles in aircraft typically each cylinder has two spark plugs each driven from a separate magneto this arrangement provides redundancy in the event of a failure of one of the <UNK> and two sparks burn more efficiently than one <UNK> combine the functions of a dynamo contact breaker points and coil into one unit the engine turns a permanent magnet inside a coil of wire to provide a basic source of electrical energy on each revolution a cam opens the contact breaker one or more times interrupting the current causing the voltage in the secondary winding of the coil to reach a very high value enough to arc across the electrodes of the spark plug because no battery or other source of energy is required the magneto is a rugged reliable and self contained solution to providing ignition of the fuel in some modern magneto designs an electronic

states music radio is a radio format where music is the primary source of broadcast content on both commercial and non commercial stations after the rise of television brought about the decline of old time radio and its dramatic content music formats became one of the dominant forms of radio in many countries though radio drama and comedy continues often on public radio music has been one of the driving factors in the advancement of radio technology from the adoption of wide band fm to the current <UNK> in digital media music radio and culture music radio particularly top four zero has often acted as both a barometer and an arbiter of musical taste and radio airplay is one of the defining measures of success in the mainstream musical world in fact the rise of rock music to popularity is intimately tied to the history of music radio early forms of rock had languished in poor areas of the south it was enjoyed mostly by rural blacks rock music entered the mainstream during the one nine five zero s because of controversial white djs such as <UNK> jack and alan freed with an appreciation for black music for many years many listeners have been dissatisfied with the content of radio programming since the decline of early free form rock radio the popularity of offshore pirate radio stations in the united kingdom was an early symptom of frustration with the often overly safe and occasionally <UNK> <UNK> of commercial radio the growth of internet radio from a small experimenter s toy in the mid nine zero s to a huge phenomenon allowing both small do it <UNK> and large commercial stations to make their offerings available worldwide was seen as a threat to over the air music broadcasting and was nearly shut down by <UNK> licensing demands made by the recording industry meanwhile the rise of satellite radio services as a major competitor have brought many of the advantages of internet radio to an increasingly mobile listening public including lack of censorship greater choice a more eclectic approach to format programming and static free digital sound quality indeed one size fits all programming is no longer seen as <UNK> by some as the diversity of musical tastes among the listening public have created a proliferation of radio formats in what some might call a form of <UNK> how it works cost of programming stations usually adopt a music format to gain the greatest number of listeners for the least expense this reasoning is common in both commercial and non commercial stations since the programming content has already been produced all that a station has to provide is the low cost on air programming between records most music radio stations pay licensing fees to licensing agencies such as <UNK> or bmi as do most commercial businesses that wish to use music as part of their business as a result while most commercial stations might get their music for free they still have to pay royalties to actually play it some small neighborhood sized stations can play <UNK> locally produced music and avoid these fees licensing issues nearly destroyed internet radio during the first years of the two one st century in the united states congress intervened to create a royalty structure that while expensive to independent operators running on a <UNK> was far less <UNK> than the scale demanded by the riaa currently one service provider live three six five provides programs that handle licensing issues in addition both xm and sirius provide commercial packages that allow the exclusive use though not <UNK> of their music programming by businesses license free commercial radio commercial stations charge advertisers for the estimated number of listeners the larger the audience the higher the stations rate card can be for commercial advertising commercial stations program the format of the station to gain as large a slice of the demographic audience as possible a station s value is usually measured as a percentage of market share in a market of a certain size the measurement in u s markets has historically been by <UNK> a commercial statistical service that uses listener diaries <UNK> diaries were historically collected on <UNK> and for this reason most radio stations have run special promotions on <UNK> hoping to persuade last minute <UNK> <UNK> to give them a larger market share stations are <UNK> prohibited from mentioning <UNK> on the air market share is not always a consideration because not all radio stations are commercial public radio is funded by government and private donors since most public broadcasting operations don t have to make a profit no commercials are necessary also satellite radio either charges subscribers or is operated by a public broadcasting service therefore satellite radio rarely carries commercials or tries to raise money from donors the lack of commercial interruptions in satellite radio is an important advantage often the only breaks in a satellite music station s programming are for station identification and dj introductions internet radio stations exist that follow all of these plans much early commercial radio was completely freeform this changed drastically with the <UNK> scandals of the one nine five zero s as a result djs seldom have complete programming freedom occasionally a special situation or highly respected long established personality is given such freedom most programming is done by the program director program directors may work for the station or at a central location run by a corporate network the dj s function is generally reduced to introducing and playing songs many stations target younger listeners because advertisers believe that advertising can change a younger person s product choice older people are thought to be less easy to change programming music radio has several possible arrangements originally it had blocks of sponsored <UNK> that played music from a live orchestra in the one nine three zero s phonograph records especially the single let a disc jockey introduce individual songs or introduce blocks of songs since then the program has been arranged so that commercials are followed by the content that is most valuable to the audience because dead air does not attract listeners the station tries to fill its broadcast day with sound audiences will only tolerate a certain number of commercials before tuning away in some regions government regulators specify how many commercials can be played in a given hour programming is different for non traditional broadcasting the jack fm format eliminates djs entirely as do many internet radio stations the music is simply played if it is announced it is by <UNK> for fm broadcast or id three tags for internet broadcast satellite radio usually uses djs but their programming blocks are longer and not distinguished much by the time of day in addition receivers usually display song titles so announcing them is not needed internet and satellite broadcasting are not considered public media so treaties and statutes concerning obscenity transmission of ciphers and public order do not apply to those formats so satellite and internet radio are free to provide sexually explicit coarse and political material typical providers include playboy radio uncensored rap and hard rock stations and outlaw country music stations the wide reach and selective non broadcast usage of the internet allows programmers access to special interest audiences as a result both mainstream and narrow interest <UNK> flourish in particular electronic music stations are much more common on the internet than they are in satellite or broadcast media <UNK> are the musical equivalent of neon signs and they can be remarkably beautiful <UNK> are brief bright pieces of choral music that promote the station s call letters frequency and sometimes disc jockey or program segment <UNK> were produced for radio stations by commercial speciality services the most famous <UNK> service was called <UNK> external link based in texas <UNK> are not as common as they used to be often being replaced by recorded <UNK> sometimes called <UNK> the station will usually have a policy of announcing time station call letters and frequency as often as six times per hour in order to build station loyalty <UNK> can very useful for giving the station a branded sound in a pleasant minimal amount of air time the legal requirement for station identification in the u s is once per hour approximately at the top of the hour or at the conclusion of a transmission news time checks real time travel advice and weather reports are often quite valuable to listeners the news headlines and station identification are often given just before a commercial time traffic and weather are given just after the engineer typically sets the station clocks to standard local time each day by listening to <UNK> or <UNK> see atomic clock although valued by commuters and older people these segments are less valued by young people so many stations that prefer to attract young listeners prefer to play music and shorten or omit these segments while most music stations that do offer news reports may simply tear and read news items from the <UNK> or the internet larger stations generally those affiliated with news talk stations may employ an editor to rewrite headlines and provide summaries of local news the summaries allow more news to fit in less air time some stations can share news collection with tv or newspapers in the same media conglomerate an emerging trend is to use the radio station s web site to provide in depth coverage of news and advertisers head lined on the air similarly many stations contract with agencies such as <UNK> and <UNK> for their weather and traffic reports instead of having in house staff to do the job most radio stations maintain a call in telephone line for use during promotions and gags or to take record requests djs generally answer the phone and edit the call during music plays some stations take requests by e mail or even online chat promotions are usually the on air equivalent of <UNK> for listeners promotional budgets usually run about one per listener per year in a large market a successful radio station can pay a full time director of promotions and several <UNK> per month of vacations automobiles and other prizes lottery items are often <UNK> from advertisers allowing both companies to charge full prices while <UNK> wholesale costs for example consider a cruise vacation cruising companies often have unused capacity and when given the choice prefer to pay their bills by <UNK> vacations since the ship will sail in any case <UNK> vacations cost the cruise company little or nothing the promotion is itself advertising for the company providing the prize programming by time most music stations have djs that play music from a playlist determined by the program director arranged by blocks of time though practices differ by region and format what follows is a typical arrangement in a north american urban commercial radio station the first block of the day is the drive time block in the early morning typically five or six am to <UNK> nine to one one am this block usually includes news bulletins and traffic and weather <UNK> for commuters as well as light comedy from the morning dj team many shock <UNK> started as or still work on drive time radio some stations emphasize music and reduce gags and call ins in this period the midday block is mostly music for a period around noon a station may play nonstop music or go to an all request format for people eating lunch in the early evening the evening rush hour programming resembles the midday programming but adds traffic and weather <UNK> for commuters some stations insert a short <UNK> of <UNK> comedy around five o clock when commuters leave work the evening block if present returns to music the overnight programming is generally low key music with quiet announcing some stations play documentaries or even <UNK> while some others play syndicated djs like <UNK> it is not uncommon to play more adventurous selections during late night programming blocks since late night is generally not considered significant for ratings weekends especially sundays often carry different programming common syndicated programming includes music countdown shows from djs such as rick <UNK> and casey <UNK> retrospective shows and world music such as the <UNK> world music hour stations may carry shows with different genres of music such as blues or jazz community affairs and religious programming is often on sunday mornings in addition weekend evenings are particularly specialized a dance station might have a sponsored dance party at a local club or a classical station may play an opera many music stations in the united states perform news and <UNK> only sparingly preferring to put more music on the air news is often restricted to the talk heavy commuting hours the bbc takes a different approach with all of its stations giving news updates bbc one <UNK> produces its own news segments under the name tx music formats some well known music radio formats are top four zero freeform rock and <UNK> album oriented rock it turns out that most other stations such as rhythm top four zero stations could sometimes be better described as top two zero stations they would aggressively skirt listener boredom to play only the most popular singles top four zero radio would <UNK> the music with <UNK> promotions gags call ins and requests brief news time and weather announcements and most importantly advertising the distinguishing mark of a traditional top four zero station was the use of a <UNK> disc jockey and high tempo <UNK> the format was invented in the us and today can be heard world wide todd <UNK> and gordon <UNK> invented top four zero radio bill drake and rick <UNK> have had a lasting modern influence this is an excellent brief history of the format variants and hybrids include the freeform like jack fm mentioned below under freeform rock and the mix formats mentioned below under oldies top four zero music is heavily criticized by some music fans as being repetitive and of low quality and is almost exclusively dominated by large media conglomerates such as clear channel communications and cbs corporation top four zero tends to be <UNK> on the internet being mostly the domain of commercial broadcasters such as virgin radio uk some of the most famous top four zero stations of have been <UNK> seven seven <UNK> new york boss radio nine three <UNK> am los angeles <UNK> eight nine <UNK> chicago and the big six eight <UNK> boston freeform and progressive rock a later development was freeform radio later commercially developed as progressive rock radio and still later even more commercially developed as <UNK> album oriented rock in which selections from an album would be played together with an appropriate introduction traditional freeform stations <UNK> themselves on offering their disc jockeys freedom to play significant music and make significant social commentary and humor this approach developed commercial problems because disc jockeys attracted to this freedom often had tastes substantially different from the audience and lost audience share also freeform stations could lack predictability and listeners loyalty could then be put at risk progressive rock radio not to be confused with the progressive rock music genre was freeform in style but constrained so that some kind of rock music was what was always or almost always played responsible <UNK> would realize their responsibility to the audience to produce a pleasant show and try to keep the station sound predictable by listening to other <UNK> and repeating some of their music selections <UNK> fm in new york during the one nine seven zero s exemplified this approach to progressive rock radio at their best freeform stations have never been equalled for their degree of social activism programmatic freedom and listener involvement however to succeed the approach requires genius <UNK> totally in tune with their audience who are also committed to the commercial success of the radio station this is a rare combination of traits even if such people are available they often command extremely high salaries however this may be an effective approach for a new station if talented <UNK> can be recruited and motivated at low salaries freeform radio is particularly popular as a college radio format offshoots include the recent and somewhat controversial due to its lack of on air personalities eclectic pop format known as jack fm from its first practitioner which plays a wide assortment of mostly top four zero music from a span of several decades and podcast radio a mostly talk format pioneered by infinity broadcasting s <UNK> station in california and adam curry s podcast show on sirius satellite radio <UNK> album oriented rock <UNK> album oriented rock developed as a commercial compromise between top forties style formulas and progressive rock radio freeform a program director or music consultant would select some set of music standards and require the playlist to be followed perhaps in an order selected by the jock the jock would still introduce each selection but the jock would have available a scripted introduction to use if he was not personally familiar with a particular piece of music and its artist obviously a computer helps a lot in this process a wonderful relatively safe compromise with the artistic freedom of the <UNK> is that a few times each hour usually in the least <UNK> valuable slots of the hour the disc jockey can highlight new tracks that he or she thinks might interest the audience the audience is encouraged to comment on the new tracks allowing the station to track audience tastes the freedom to introduce new artists can help a station develop its library significant <UNK> offshoots include classic rock and adult album alternative oldies standards and classic rock not playing new artists has been described as a weakness of classic rock or oldies formats this is true in a creative but not a commercial sense stations will not get good ratings if they frequently play songs unfamiliar to their audience this is why top four zero stations played only the biggest hits and why oldies and classic rock formats do the same for the eras they cover nevertheless there seems to be a cottage industry of internet stations specializing in specific forms of classic rock and oldies particularly psychedelic rock and progressive rock the oldies and classic rock formats have a strong niche market but as the audience becomes older the station becomes less attractive to advertisers advertisers perceive older listeners as set in their brand choices and not as responsive to advertising as younger more <UNK> listeners oldies stations must occasionally change to more youthful music formats as a result the definition of what constitutes an oldies station has gradually changed over the years this preference for younger listeners caused the decline of the big band or standards music formats that covered music from the one nine three zero s to the one nine five zero s as the audience grew too old for advertisers the radio stations that carried these formats saw a sharp loss of ratings and revenue this left them with no choice but to adopt more youthful formats though the standards format also known as the great american <UNK> from the series of albums produced by rocker rod stewart has undergone something of an off air revival with artists such as stewart tony bennett and queen <UNK> putting their own interpretation on the music during the mid to late nine zero s the mix format a loosely defined mixture of top four zero and classic rock with something of an emphasis on adult contemporary music began to appear across the country while the format has no particular standard identity most mix stations have rotations consisting largely of pop and rock music from the eight zero s and nine zero s and often the seven zero s with some current material mixed in in addition stations devoted to the pop music of the seven zero s eight zero s and nine zero s on their own have developed as the audiences that grew up with that music grew older and nostalgic for the sounds of their youth classical pop easy listening jazz dance these formats all have small but very loyal audiences in the largest markets most follow formats similar to the above top four zero s freeform <UNK> and oldies except with a different playlist public service stations following these formats tend to be freeform stations classical music radio is just as it sounds radio designed to appeal to the listener of classical music internet classical most classical stations specialize primarily in instrumental classical music and chamber music though there are more special interest classical stations often found through media such as satellite radio or internet radio that carry classical pop music or operatic music easy listening and adult contemporary are related formats that play largely down tempo pop music of various styles the difference is mostly in the era and styles covered easy listening is mostly older music done in the style of standards from the early two zero th century typical artists include johnny <UNK> and frank sinatra internet streaming combined with big band music and more modern performers in the same style such as <UNK> dion and josh <UNK> while adult contemporary focuses more on newer pop music from the one nine seven zero s on an ancestor to the easy listening format is beautiful music a now rare format though xm features one channel of it called sunny focusing mostly on smooth jazz or classical arrangements of pop music and original compositions in a similar vein jazz stations generally play either traditional jazz forms or smooth jazz the jazz station more than any other except the college station is stereotyped as having a small <UNK> and a somewhat overly <UNK> on air personality and many are college run stations california state university long beach sponsors <UNK> eight eight one which has a fairly significant online <UNK> as well dance music is a niche and so called rhythmic pop stations have had a fierce but not always commercially sustainable following there was a wide spectrum of disco format radio stations during the late seven zero s but virtually all of them died out during the disco backlash <UNK> in boston is one of the few notable survivors now a clear channel communications owned top four zero station of considerable influence nevertheless there are a large number of dance music stations available both on the internet and on satellite radio mostly specializing in various forms of electronica both major us satellite radio services include disco stations alternative and modern rock rock music has a long and honorable radio tradition going back to djs like <UNK> jack and alan freed and as a result variations on rock radio are fairly common the classic rock and oldies formats are discussed above in addition to those however there are several genres of music radio devoted to different aspects of modern rock music alternative rock grew out of the grunge scene of the late eight zero s and early nine zero s and is particularly favored by college radio and adult album alternative stations there is a strong focus on songwriters and bands with an outsider sound or a more sophisticated sound than the three chord wonder <UNK> meanwhile other stations focus on heavy metal punk rock or the various post punk and pop influenced sounds known collectively as modern rock narrow interest rock stations are particularly common on the internet and satellite radio scenes broken down into genres such as punk metal classic rock indie music and the like there is a general feeling among radio connoisseurs that rock radio is becoming badly watered down by big corporate ownership leading to a considerable do it yourself spirit true country music while stereotyped as rural music the country format is common and popular throughout the united states and in some other countries emphasis is generally on current pop country though stations specializing in older country music have popped up here and there country has been a popular radio format since the early days of music radio country music stations are broken in two <UNK> classic country and hot country urban hip hop r urban due to the fact that the styles it represents are largely developed from the street and underground music of urban american blacks in the one nine seven zero s though the music itself has considerable popularity and controversy due to its often nihilistic and hedonistic themes among all ethnic groups and social classes public radio formats some music radio is broadcast by public service organizations such as national public radio or the bbc these usually resemble freeform stations with particular programs for different types of music more popular formats get more popular hours the avant garde programs tend to be pushed to the late night and early morning slots there is a vast variety in the formats used in public broadcasting while the american form represented largely by national public radio and public radio international is generally thought of being dry and academic public broadcasters in other countries have more variety in their programming the bbc for example has eleven national or international radio stations in english alone five of which are devoted primarily to music with roughly another fifty regional and local stations public radio music formats tend to be grouped into broad genres with most public broadcasters offering at least a pop station such as ireland s rte two fm and a classical jazz station in addition college radio stations often operate as public broadcasters promotional usages music radio is also a means of promoting other enterprises such as a record label or ad hoc music events in which the broadcasters have a commercial interest the majority of music radio stations in the united states and canada are commercial stations that sell advertising to pay for their facilities and transmitters in addition many of the larger stations run promotional events such as dance nights concerts and even in the case of some larger stations entire music festivals on air contests and <UNK> are common features as are philanthropic programs usually charitable promotions run during holiday seasons song picking music radio has been helped by the development of semi automated song picker programs basically these present the disc jockey with a list of commercially acceptable music selections and other items for the current time slot these give the disc jockey some artistic freedom to select songs promotions <UNK> etc and yet still assure a cohesive station sound and good audience satisfaction they also reduce a disc jockey s workload allowing him or her to develop news items run the station prepare gags or take call ins while a song is playing the employer may as a result reduce staffing levels and thus trim overhead costs technology while music radio like all radio started out on am it is somewhat unusual at least in developed countries to have a music station on am due to the relatively poor sound bandwidth available in a nine or one zero khz channel as a result since the late six zero s and early seven zero s there has been a wholesale shift to using fm stereo for maximum sound quality the two zero zero khz bands assigned in most countries to fm radio stations are more than adequate to carry a two channeled stereo audio signal along with several <UNK> that serve various purposes nevertheless up through the early nine zero s a large number of stations still programmed substantial amounts of music on the am bands a practice that still continues for some limited formats am stereo in fact though rarely supported on consumer equipment outside of japan can provide near fm quality sound and is required for many stations operating in what in the united states is known as the x band one six two zero one seven one zero khz some fm stations also broadcast sca programming such as multilingual translations and leased content using a <UNK> music radio has progressed behind the microphone over the years originally the disk jockeys were just that people who announced and spun vinyl records high fidelity tape carts from cartridges was the standard through much of the seven zero s and eight zero s phased out in favor of compact disc and eventually computer controlled mp

for satellite radio to transmit static free programming and <UNK> digital <UNK> sometimes referred to as hd radio <UNK> transmissions and digital audio broadcasting are both in use in the western

broadcasters such as deutsche <UNK> no international music stations using the technology have yet been launched internet radio generally uses standard streaming protocols with the data most often in

mmorpgs are distinguished from single player or small multi player rpgs by the game s persistent world usually hosted by the game s publisher which continues to exist and evolve while the player is away from the game this results in a <UNK> which is far more dynamic diverse and realistic than those of other games mmorpgs are immensely popular with several commercial games reporting millions of subscribers south korea boasts the highest subscription numbers with millions of users registered with the more popular games see list of mmorpgs for a list of the most prominent mmorpgs common features though mmorpgs have evolved considerably many of them share various characteristics traditional dungeons and dragons style gameplay including quests monsters and loot a system for character

organizations of players whether or not the game supports them game moderators in charge of supervising the world as most mmorpgs are commercial like everquest and world of warcraft players must either purchase the client software for a one time fee or pay a monthly subscription fee to play most major mmorpgs require players do both these things some free of charge mmorpgs do exist though their production quality is generally lower compared to pay to play counterparts history mmorpgs as we define them today have existed since the early one nine nine zero s however they have a history that extends back into the late one nine seven zero s the first <UNK> the beginning of the mmorpg genre can be traced back to text based multi user dungeons or muds the first of which was developed by richard bartle and roy <UNK> in one nine seven eight these were <UNK> hosted on private servers usually at a university sometimes without the knowledge of the system s administrators which players would connect to using a telnet client gameplay was usually similar to tabletop rpgs such as dungeons and dragons by typing commands into a parser players would enter a dungeon fight monsters gain experience and <UNK> loot similar games quickly developed around the same time for the plato system muds and later descendants such as <UNK> and <UNK> were wildly different in implementation from one another but shared many basic interface elements for example a player would usually navigate his or her character around the <UNK> by typing in compass directions n se etc many muds are still active to this day and the most influential mmorpg designers such as <UNK> <UNK> brad <UNK> mark jacobs and <UNK> schubert began as mud developers and or players early commercial development the first

users could interact with one another chat and exchange items although very simple its use of online avatars already well established off line by ultima and other games and combining chat with graphics was revolutionary for the time the term avatar for an on screen player character may have originated at lucasarts as part of the habitat project <UNK> nights the first graphical mmorpg the

personally championed and green lighted by aol president steve case both club <UNK> and <UNK> nights cost six zero zero per hour to play during the early one nine nine zero s commercial use of the internet was limited by nsfnet acceptable use policies consequently early online games like <UNK> nights gemstone iii dragon s gate and federation ii relied upon proprietary services for distribution such as compuserve america online and genie following <UNK> nights was the shadow of <UNK> a mmorpg within the sierra network <UNK> which ran from one nine nine two through one nine nine six the game

a broader more massive market meridian five nine and ultima online also set the precedent for monthly one zero usd subscriptions a figure that would later gradually increase across the genre these

played american mmorpgs with a total of over five million customers worldwide with the release of these newer games subscriptions began to decline for old games such as lineage ii and everquest one the release of guild wars in april two zero zero five represented <UNK> s investment in the possible profitability of an online rpg with a one time fee guild wars did not share many of the distinguishing features of typical mmorpgs such as the massive persistent game world the subscription fee the large time investment required to play and the largely server dependent software architecture and as such was termed a competitive online role playing game <UNK> by the developers another korean mmorpg <UNK> a side <UNK> developed by <UNK> likewise contains free gameplay however it covers its costs through <UNK> game enhancements due to its free nature the game is said to have more than three zero million players in all of its many versions with the majority of them from east asia on august four two zero zero five the chinese government announced a ban on all violent gameplay for minors under one eight chinese officials defined violent as any game that involves player vs player combat a common feature among mmorpgs later in august the same year the chinese government imposed online gaming <UNK> so players will gain experience and items in game at a decreased and decreasing rate until it hits zero after five hours of consecutive gameplay after which the player must log off for five hours to get the full rate back academic attention mmorpgs have begun to attract significant academic attention notably in the fields of economics and psychology edward <UNK> specializes in the study of virtual worlds muds <UNK> and similar concepts most of his writings including virtual worlds a first hand account of market and society on the <UNK> frontier two zero zero one have examined relationships between real world economies and synthetic economies with the growing popularity of the genre a growing number of psychologists and sociologists study the actions and interactions of the players in such games one of the more famous of these researchers is sherry <UNK> another researcher is nick <UNK> who has surveyed more than three five zero zero zero mmorpg players over the past few years focusing on psychological and sociological aspects of these games his research can be found at the daedalus project independent development <UNK> is one of the independent efforts to create a free mmorpg many small teams of programmers and artists have tried to create their own mmorpgs the average mmorpg project takes three to four years and large investments of money to create independent development or game development not run by any company usually takes longer due to lack of developer s time manpower or money additionally the long term lack of funding required for running mmorpg servers may lead to the abandonment of the project sometimes these independent games are free to play but will confer in game privileges to paying customers the best established independent projects are <UNK> <UNK> endless online and <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> are entirely open source the developers of endless online have released technical development information with details about their coding the <UNK> project has been active since one nine nine eight and formed a community of independent developers who are working on creating framework for a number of open source mmorpgs browser based mmorpgs with the success of the mmorpg genre in recent years several multiplayer games played in web browsers have also begun using the mmorpg moniker this largely text based sub genre developed from old bbs games and pre dates the modern idea of an mmorpg browser based mmorpgs are usually simpler games than their stand alone counterparts typically involving turn based play and simple strategies e g build a large army then attack other players for gold though there are many interesting variations on the popular themes to be found many of these games are more like turn based strategy games or wargames than role playing games in <UNK> players control planets and fleets of ships in kings of chaos the player commands an army rather than a single player character in <UNK> the player controls a character who owns a spaceship and gains experience points through trading or fighting in a way similar to the classic game elite legend of the green dragon is an example of a text based mmorpg accessible with a web browser one of the earliest examples of a browser based mmorpg is <UNK> which dates back to early one nine nine nine currently an extremely popular browser based mmorpg kings of chaos boasts a player population numbering in the hundreds of thousands its popularity is primarily fuelled by a reciprocal link clicking system where users give each other more soldiers by clicking on their friends unique links taking advantage of the small world phenomenon to spread word of the game across the world some examples of click based mmorpg s are legend of the green dragon and world of <UNK> whose code is open source allowing anyone to create their own game server another browser based mmorpg kingdom of loathing largely parodies other games some of the more popular of these have become profitable through user subscriptions not all browser based mmorpgs are turn based text games more recently faster computers and the java programming language have allowed the introduction of graphical browser based mmorpgs such as <UNK> produced by <UNK> which are more similar to standalone mmorpgs genre challenges most mmorpgs require significant development resources to overcome the logistical hurdles associated with such large production efforts online games require virtual worlds significant hardware requirements e g servers and bandwidth and dedicated support staff despite the efforts of developers <UNK> of these issues reviewers often cite non optimal populations such as overcrowding or under populated worlds lag and poor support as problems of games in this genre these problems tend to be worse for free mmorpgs peer to peer mmorpgs could theoretically scale better because peers share the resource load but practical issues such as asymmetrical network bandwidth and cpu hungry rendering engines make peer to peer mmorpgs a difficult proposition additionally they become vulnerable to other problems such as cheating several mmorpgs have suffered through technical difficulties through the first few days or weeks after launch early successes such as ultima online and everquest managed to pass through this stage with little permanent damage few games may have significant failures leading ultimately to their demise if they launch too early and contain frequent bug fixes <UNK> or structural game changes that may discourage players from continuing to play the game due to these problems games such as anarchy online and world war ii online struggled to regain good press after their first month and gained good press after stabilizing their servers dark age of camelot and city of heroes showed hardly any signs of such difficulties cheating cheating is a major challenge for the game developers as it is done in many ways exploiting is a form of cheating involving the use of a flaw in the game mechanics to gain unfair advantage depending on the nature of the exploit game developers can fix the exploits within hours or even minutes through patches and updates although some holes last weeks or months before they are detected or reported even when fixed exploiting can still be an issue as <UNK> may still have the advantage they gained before the patch was released depending on the seriousness of the exploit a <UNK> may be needed just to counter the effects the exploits had external or three rd party programs are another type of cheat they can be used to automate legitimate actions that were intended to be accomplished by the users themselves often with such efficiency that it provides a huge advantage <UNK> is a term for a player using a script that could automate progress through the game without them actually playing the game for themselves this could be done through a simple macro program which records <UNK> and mouse movements or scripting program that could make smart <UNK> such as ac tools farmers if they are unable to exploit loop holes in the game will use such methods to harvest materials or gold from the game world right around the clock requiring a little more talent on the <UNK> part along with some <UNK> social engineering some third party programs are released with code in them to capture and relay account details back to the author enabling them to steal virtual <UNK> from the account or <UNK> the rightful owner to <UNK> confidence tricks and other scams these trojans often masquerade as a free utility to help with some common game related task such as character template design even more subtle methods are known to be used to gain an edge and as these require the most skill they can be hard to detect depending on the way the game handles certain aspects of gameplay the client or components thereof can be modified either on disk directly in memory or on the wire as data passes between the client and server all the while the server does not verify the veracity of client data or ideally take care of important calculations server side this can be used to modify values such as character health or armour speed up movement or subtly change other non trivial aspects of the game to the <UNK> s advantage there are programs that have been designed to prevent external programs from running during a game such as <UNK> the integrity of client files can also be checked each time you load the game although of course some gamers have found ways to bypass or disable these protection programs private servers single client based graphic mmorpgs may have private servers or server emulators private servers are mostly run by volunteers therefore most of them are free however some private servers may wish for people to donate money sometimes in exchange for a bonus in the game private servers remain markedly less popular than the official servers with player numbers in the hundreds not thousands <UNK> is a server emulator for everquest others exist for world of warcraft lineage ii ultima online and many other mmorpgs in china as well as many other asian countries the use of private servers is more prevalent most chinese mmorpg players are aware of the existence of private servers and according to statistics more people prefer private servers than official servers the reasons for this are the relatively high fees for official servers and the availability of one zero zero mb s fiber optic internet connections which can be as cheap as us three zero a month also the costs of running a server in china are also remarkably low in one instance a private server had more than five zero zero zero zero players registered some even have one zero zero zero accounts in one day the opening day among such cases are mu

development many gamers in china feel the companies that developed mmorpgs <UNK> made the leveling progress advance slowly so more money could be made off the gamers most of the private servers have

posted at gamespy com concerning the past present and future of the genre computer and video game genres massively multiplayer online role playing games this article is about multiplication in mathematics for multiplication in music see multiplication music redirects here this symbol is also used in a botanical hybrid name in mathematics multiplication is an arithmetic operation which is the inverse of division and in elementary arithmetic can be interpreted as repeated addition in its simplest form multiplication is the sum of a list of identical numbers for example the product seven four is seven seven seven seven the numbers being multiplied are called the <UNK> and multiplier or the factors notation multiplication can be denoted in several equivalent ways all of the following mean five times two five two five two five two five two five two five two five two five two five two five two the asterisk is often used on computers because it is a symbol on every keyboard but it is rarely used when writing math by hand this usage originated in the fortran programming language frequently multiplication is implied by juxtaposition rather than shown in a notation this is standard in algebra taking forms like five x and xy this is potentially confusing if variables are permitted to have names longer than one letter the notation is not used with numbers alone five two never means five two if the terms are not written out individually then the product may be written with an ellipsis to mark out the missing terms as with other series operations like sums thus the product of all the natural numbers from one to one zero zero can be written one cdot two cdot ldots cdot nine nine cdot one zero zero this can also be written with the ellipsis vertically placed in the middle of the line as one cdot two cdot cdots cdot nine nine cdot one zero zero alternatively the product can be written with the product symbol which derives from the capital letter pi in the greek alphabet this is defined as prod x x cdot x cdot x cdot cdots cdot x cdot x the subscript gives the symbol for a dummy variable i in our case and its lower value m the superscript gives its upper value so for example prod left one right left one right cdot left one right cdot left one right cdot left one right cdot left one right one may also consider products of infinitely many terms these are called infinite products <UNK> we would replace n above by the infinity symbol the product of such a series is defined as the limit of the product of the first n terms as n grows without bound that is prod x lim prod x one can similarly replace m with negative infinity and prod infty x i left lim prod m x i right cdot left lim prod n x i right for some integer m provided both limits exist definition as for what multiplication means the product of two whole numbers n and m is mn sum n m this is just a shorthand for saying add m to itself n times expanding the above to make its meaning more clear m n m m m m such that there are n m s added together so for instance five two five five one zero two five two two two two two one zero four three four four four one two m six m m m m m m using this definition it is easy to prove some interesting properties of multiplication as the first two examples above hint at the order in which two numbers are multiplied does not matter this is called the commutative property and it turns out to be true in general that for any two numbers x and y x y y x multiplication also has what is called the associative property the associative property means that for any three numbers x y and z x y z x y z note from algebra the parentheses mean that the operations inside the parentheses must be done before anything outside the parentheses is done multiplication also has what is called a distributive property with respect to the addition because x y z xy <UNK> also of interest is that any number times one is equal to itself thus one x x and this is called the identity property in this regard the number one is known as the multiplicative identity what about zero well we have m zero m m m m where there are zero m s added together the sum of zero m s is zero so m zero zero no matter what m is as long as it is finite multiplication with negative numbers also requires a little thought first consider negative one for any positive integer m one m one one one m this is an interesting fact that shows that any negative number is just negative one multiplied by a positive number so multiplication with any integers can be represented by multiplication of whole numbers and one s all that remains is to explicitly define one one one one one one in this way the multiplication of any two integers is defined the definitions can be extended to larger and larger sets of numbers first to vulgar fractions called the rational numbers then to infinitely long decimals called real numbers and then to the complex numbers students are sometimes <UNK> when told that the result of multiplying no numbers is one a formal recursive definition of multiplication can be given by the rules x zero zero x y x x y one where x is a real number and y is a natural number once multiplication has been defined for natural numbers it can be extended to include integers and then to real and complex numbers computation for fast ways to compute products of large numbers see multiplication algorithms some algorithms are suitable for multiplying numbers using pencil and paper most such as lattice multiplication require a multiplication table of memorized

applied to cereal grains in which the grains are made to germinate and then quickly dried before the plant develops the term malt refers to several products of the process the grains to which this

freemasonry masonry is the building of structures from individual units laid in and bound together by mortar the common materials of masonry construction are brick stone such as marble granite <UNK> limestone concrete block glass block and tile masonry is generally a highly durable form of construction however the materials used the quality of the mortar and <UNK> and the pattern the units are laid in can strongly affect the durability of the overall masonry construction a brick wall built using the flemish bond applications masonry is commonly used for the walls of buildings retaining walls and monuments brick is the most common type of masonry and may be either weight bearing or a <UNK> concrete block masonry is rapidly gaining in popularity as a comparable material blocks most of which have hollow cores offer various possibilities in masonry construction generally providing great compressive strength and they re generally best suited to structures with light transverse loading when the cores remain <UNK> filling some or all of the cores with concrete stone or steel reinforcement typically <UNK> offers much greater tensile and lateral strength to structures advantages the use of materials such as brick and stone can increase the thermal mass of a building giving increased comfort in the heat of summer and the cold of winter and can be ideal for passive solar applications brick typically will not require painting and so can provide a structure with reduced life cycle costs although sealing appropriately will reduce potential <UNK> due to frost damage concrete block of the non decorative variety generally is painted or <UNK> if exposed the appearance especially when well crafted can impart an impression of <UNK> and permanence disadvantages extreme weather may cause degradation of the surface due to frost damage this type of damage is common with certain types of brick though relatively rare with concrete block if non concrete clay based brick is to be used care should be taken to select bricks suitable for the climate in question masonry must be built upon a firm foundation usually reinforced concrete to avoid settling and potentially cracking if expansive soils such as adobe clay are present this foundation may need to be quite elaborate and the services of a qualified structural engineer may be required the high weight increases structural requirements especially in earthquake prone areas structural limitations masonry boasts an impressive compressive strength vertical loads but is much lower in tensile strength twisting or stretching unless reinforced the tensile strength of masonry walls can be strengthened by thickening the wall or by building masonry piers vertical columns or ribs at intervals where practical steel reinforcement also can be introduced vertically and or horizontally to greatly increase tensile strength though this is most commonly done with poured walls one technique used to boost the tensile strength of poured concrete is called <UNK> this involves stretching steel rods and essentially pouring concrete around them to form heavy construction elements such as bridge <UNK> and <UNK> plank after the concrete is cured the steel rods are cut off at the ends and it contracts just enough to pull the concrete inward increase its density slightly and greatly increase its strength against these sideways loads <UNK> masonry brick <UNK> construction has strength imparted by a framework of wood or a rough masonry wall of other material over which is placed a layer of bricks for <UNK> and providing a finished appearance the brick <UNK> wall is connected to the structural walls by brick ties metal strips that are attached to the structural wall as well as the mortar joints of the brick <UNK> wall there typically is an air gap between the brick <UNK> wall and the structural wall as clay brick is not completely waterproof the structural wall has a water resistant surface usually tar paper and weep holes are left at the base of the brick <UNK> wall to <UNK> the air gap <UNK> walls often are structurally superior to solid un reinforced brick walls because the core can be constructed of block reinforced by steel and or poured concrete block also may offer opportunities to run utilities within the wall if some block cores can be left <UNK> for this purpose most insulated buildings that utilize concrete block brick <UNK> or some combination thereof feature interior insulation in the form of fiberglass <UNK> between wooden wall <UNK> or rigid insulation boards covered with plaster or <UNK> in most climates this insulation is much more effective on the exterior of the wall allowing the building interior to take advantage of the aforementioned thermal mass of the masonry this technique does however require some sort of weather resistant exterior surface over the insulation and consequently is generally more expensive dry set masonry dry set masonry supports a rustic log bridge where it provides a well drained support for the log this will increase its service life the strength of a masonry wall is not entirely dependent on the bond between the building material and the mortar the friction between the interlocking blocks of masonry is often strong enough to provide a great deal of strength on its own the blocks sometimes have grooves or other surface features added to enhance this interlocking and some dry set masonry structures <UNK> mortar all together solid masonry solid masonry without steel reinforcement tends to have very limited applications in modern wall construction while such walls can be quite economical and suitable in some applications susceptibility to earthquakes and collapse is a major issue solid <UNK> masonry walls tend to be low and thick as a consequence brick solid brick masonry is made of two or more layers of bricks with the units running horizontally called <UNK> bricks bound together with bricks running transverse to the wall called header bricks each row of bricks is known as a course the pattern of headers and <UNK> employed gives rise to different bonds such as the common bond with every sixth course composed of headers the english bond and the flemish bond with alternating <UNK> and header bricks present on every course there are no significant utilitarian differences between most bonds but the appearance of the finished wall is affected vertically staggered bonds tend to be somewhat stronger and less prone to major cracking than a non staggered bond uniformity and <UNK> the selection of the brick used especially for color will affect the appearance of the final surface in buildings built during the one nine seven zero s a high degree of uniformity of brick and accuracy in masonry was typical in later periods this style was thought to be too sterile so attempts were made to emulate older <UNK> work some brick surfaces are made to look particularly rustic by including burnt bricks which have a darker color or an irregular shape others may use antique salvage bricks or new bricks may be artificially aged by applying various surface treatments the attempts at <UNK> of the late two zero th century have been carried forward by masons specializing in a free artistic style where the courses are intentionally not straight instead weaving to form more organic impressions serpentine masonry a <UNK> <UNK> wall is a brick wall that follows a serpentine path rather than a straight line this type of wall is more resistant to toppling than a straight wall so much so that it may be made of a single thickness of <UNK> brick and so despite its longer length may be more economical than a straight wall concrete block blocks of <UNK> concrete <UNK> blocks or <UNK> ordinary concrete concrete blocks or hollow tile are generically known as concrete masonry units <UNK> s they usually are much larger than ordinary bricks and so are much faster to lay for a wall of a given size furthermore <UNK> and tile blocks have much lower water absorption rates than brick they often are used as the structural core for <UNK> brick masonry or are used alone for the walls of factories <UNK> and other industrial buildings where appearance is not a significant factor such blocks often receive a <UNK> surface for decoration surface bonding cement sometimes is used in this application and can impart extra strength to a block wall the primary advantage of concrete blocks in comparison to smaller clay based bricks is that a <UNK> structure can be reinforced by either fully <UNK> the voids or inserting vertical lengths of <UNK> and using <UNK> to hold them in place in this manner a <UNK> wall can be built much stronger than typical masonry walls some concrete blocks are colored and some employ a split face a technique that results in two blocks being manufactured as one unit and later split into two this gives the blocks a rough face replicating the appearance of natural quarried stone such as <UNK> examples of <UNK> block as well as other types of <UNK> and brick can be seen here for applications such as roadway sound control walls the patterns may be complex and even artistic decorative <UNK> have gained in popularity also with units featuring a glazed <UNK> or glossy finish emerging as innovative new options in interior <UNK>

usually have a smooth finish and can have a visible internal aggregates a solid uniformly colored <UNK> or a visible aggregates protected by a clear <UNK> stone stone blocks used in masonry can be dressed or rough stone masonry utilizing dressed stones is known as <UNK> masonry whereas masonry using irregularly shaped stones is known as rubble masonry both rubble and <UNK> masonry can be laid in courses rows of even height through the careful selection or cutting of stones but a great deal of stone masonry is <UNK> sometimes river rock <UNK> shaped smooth stones is used as a <UNK> this type of material is not favored for solid masonry as it requires a great amount of mortar and can lack intrinsic structural strength growing in popularity among builders and <UNK> are manufactured stone <UNK> companies such as cultured stone a division of owens <UNK> and boulder creek stone pull natural stones from quarries around the world create molds from them and recreate those stones with concrete to the casual observer and even many masons there is no visual difference between <UNK> of natural and manufactured stone <UNK> <UNK> are rectangular wire baskets usually of zinc protected steel that are filled with fractured stone of medium size these will act a single unit and are stacked with set backs to form a <UNK> or retaining wall they have the advantage of being both well

climates such as shore side in a salt water environment must be made of appropriate corrosion resistant wire <UNK> concrete a low grade concrete may be placed in woven plastic sacks similar to that used for <UNK> and then <UNK> the sacks are then watered and the <UNK> then becomes a series of artificial stones that conform to one another and to adjacent soil and structures this conformation

company created in one nine two eight by walt disney and ub <UNK> the mouse has evolved from being simply a character in animated cartoons and comic strips to become one of the most recognizable symbols in the world walt disney himself voiced mickey mouse from one nine two eight until one nine four six when sound effects man james g macdonald took over the role mickey has been voiced since one nine eight three by wayne <UNK> macdonald s former apprentice the icon mickey s most recognizable look has him wearing red shorts and yellow shoes mickey mouse may be the most recognized symbol of america except for the flag for some he symbolizes the country s cultural imperialism the spread of its culture to other places in the world for others he represents happiness and innocence he is the symbol for the walt disney company and in many ways walt disney himself it was said by lillian disney his wife that over the years mickey and walt grew together and were mirrors of each other s personality they both started off mischievous but as they grew older preferred to step out of the spotlight and observe others work their magic president jimmy carter once said mickey mouse is the symbol of goodwill surpassing all languages and cultures when one sees mickey mouse they see happiness the mickey icon a three circle silhouette of mickey s head serves as the logo for most of disney s subsidiaries which contain the name disney andy warhol s portrait the art of mickey mouse used warhol s famous pop art techniques on the classic mouse creation and debut mickey s first appearance in plane crazy mickey was created by ub <UNK> as a replacement for oswald the lucky rabbit an earlier star created by the disney studio oswald had also been created by ub <UNK> with limited input from walt disney for charles <UNK> of universal studios in fact mickey closely resembled oswald in his early appearances however disney received an unpleasant surprise when he asked <UNK> for a larger budget for his popular oswald series in reply <UNK> announced he had hired the bulk of disney s staff but that disney could keep doing the oswald series as long as he agreed to a budget cut and went on the payroll <UNK> owned oswald and thought he had disney over a barrel angrily disney refused the deal and returned to california to produce the final oswald cartoons he <UNK> owed <UNK> disney was dismayed at the betrayal by his staff but determined to restart from scratch the new disney studio initially consisted of <UNK> and a loyal apprentice artist les clark one lesson disney learned from the experience was to thereafter always make sure that he owned all rights to the characters produced by his company in order for walt and his older brother and business partner roy to keep their company active new characters had to be created to star in their subsequent animated shorts one day during a train ride walt desperately wanted to come up with a money making character to replace the one he lost oswald he had visions of a mouse in the back of his head he had previously made silent cartoon shorts with animated mice he wanted to name his new creation mortimer mouse but his wife lillian marie bounds thought the name was too pretentious so he changed it to mickey mouse the name mortimer would later be used for a character in a mickey cartoon it has been suggested that walt disney was influenced by an actual mouse that he almost tamed by feeding it <UNK> on his desk at the laugh o gram studio we felt that the public and especially the children like animals that are cute and little i think we are rather indebted to charlie chaplin for the idea we wanted something appealing and we thought of a tiny bit of a mouse that would have something of the <UNK> of chaplin a little fellow trying to do the best he could when people laugh at mickey mouse it s because he s so human and that is the secret of his popularity i only hope that we don t lose sight of one thing that it was all started by a mouse walt disney mickey and minnie mouse mickey s girlfriend debuted in the cartoon short plane crazy first released on may one five one nine two eight the short was co directed by walt disney and ub <UNK> <UNK> was also the main animator for this short and reportedly spent six weeks working on it in fact ub <UNK> was the main animator for every disney short released in one nine two eight and one nine two nine he left disney in one nine three zero in order to form his own studio and introduced flip the frog in the first sound cartoon made in color hugh harman and rudolf <UNK> also assisting disney during one nine two eight and one nine two nine these two had already signed their contracts with charles <UNK> but he was still in the process of forming his new studio and so for the time being they were still employed by disney this short would be the last they animated under this somewhat awkward situation the plot of plane crazy was fairly simple mickey is apparently trying to become an aviator in emulation of charles lindbergh after building his own aircraft he proceeds to ask minnie to join him for its first flight during which he repeatedly and unsuccessfully attempts to kiss her eventually resorting to force minnie then parachutes out of the plane while distracted by her mickey loses control of the plane this becomes the beginning of an out of control flight that results in a series of humorous situations and eventually in the crash landing of the aircraft a non anthropomorphic cow that briefly becomes a passenger in the aircraft is believed to be <UNK> cow making her debut mickey as portrayed in plane crazy was mischievous <UNK> and has often been described as a rogue modern audiences have occasionally commented on this version of mickey as being somewhat more complex and consequently more interesting than his later self at the time of its first release however plane crazy apparently failed to impress audiences and to add insult to injury walt could not find a distributor though understandably disappointed walt went on to produce a second mickey short the <UNK> <UNK> early landmarks image pa one nine zero zero nine nine jpg first encounter with black peg leg pete the <UNK> <UNK> was again co directed by walt disney and ub <UNK> with the latter serving as the sole animator in this case the short was intended as a parody of douglas fairbanks s the <UNK> a film first released on november two one one nine two seven following the original film the events of the short take place in the <UNK> of argentina the <UNK> of the title was mickey himself he is first seen riding on a rhea instead of a horse as would be expected or an ostrich as often reported he soon encounters <UNK> argentina apparently serving as the local bar and restaurant mickey proceeds to enter the establishment and take a seat he apparently just wants to relax with some drinking and tobacco smoking also present at the establishment are black pete later renamed peg leg pete or just pete a wanted outlaw and fellow customer for the time being and minnie mouse the <UNK> and dancer of the establishment at the time performing a tango both customers soon begin to <UNK> with minnie and to rival one another at some point pete proceeds in kidnapping minnie and attempts to escape on his horse mickey gives chase on his rhea he soon catches up to his rival and they proceed to fight with swords mickey emerges the victor of this <UNK> the finale of the short has mickey and minnie riding the rhea into the distance in later interviews <UNK> would comment that mickey as featured in the <UNK> <UNK> was intended to be a <UNK> an adventurer modeled after fairbanks himself this short marks the first encounter between mickey and black pete a character already established as an antagonist in both the alice comedies and the oswald series based on mickey and minnie acting as strangers to each other before the finale it was presumably intended to feature their original acquaintance to each other as well modern audiences have commented that all three characters seem to be coming out of rough lower class backgrounds that little resemble their later versions consequently the short is arguably of some historical significance at the time of its original production though walt again failed to find a distributor it would be first released on december three zero one nine two eight following the release of another mickey short reportedly mickey was at first thought to be much too similar to oswald and this resulted in the apparent lack of interest in him walt would soon start to contemplate ways to distinguish the mickey mouse series from his previous work and that of his rivals the result of his <UNK> would be the third mickey short to be produced the second to be released and the first to really draw the attention of the audiences steamboat willie addition of sound to the series mickey in steamboat willie steamboat willie was first released on november one eight one nine two eight it was co directed by walt disney and ub <UNK> <UNK> again served as the head animator assisted by johnny cannon les clark wilfred jackson and dick lundy this short was intended as a parody of buster keaton s steamboat bill jr first released on may one two of the same year despite the fact this was not the first mickey cartoon made or released it is still considered by some as mickey mouse s true debut the cartoon is often listed in history books as being the first animated film ever to feature a synchronized sound music and dialogue track but fleischer studios headed by brothers dave and max fleischer had already released some sound cartoons using the <UNK> system in the mid one nine two zero s as a matter of fact disney got the idea of making a sound cartoon after watching an aesop s film fable cartoon entitled dinner time this series was <UNK> by path and produced by paul terry steamboat willie was however the first sound cartoon to achieve wide recognition animation historians have long debated who had served as the composer for the film s original music this role has been variously attributed to wilfred jackson carl stalling and bert lewis but identification remains uncertain walt disney himself acted as voice actor for both mickey and minnie the script had mickey serving aboard steamboat willie under captain pete at first he is seen piloting the steamboat while whistling then pete arrives to take over piloting and angrily throws him out of the boat s bridge they soon have to stop for cargo to be transferred on board almost as soon as they leave minnie arrives she was apparently supposed to be their only passenger but was late to board mickey manages to pick her up from the river shore minnie accidentally drops her sheet music for the popular folk song turkey in the straw a goat which was among the animals transported on the steamboat proceeds to eat the sheet music consequently mickey and minnie use its tail to turn it into a phonograph which is playing the tune through the rest of the short mickey uses various other animals as musical instruments later audiences have often described those scenes as humorously exaggerated examples of animal cruelty captain pete is eventually disturbed by all this noise and places mickey back to work mickey is reduced to <UNK> potatoes for the rest of the trip a parrot attempts to make fun of him but is then thrown to the river by mickey this served as the final scene of this short audiences at the time of steamboat willie s release were reportedly impressed by its use of sound for comedic purposes sound films were still considered innovative the first feature length movie with dialogue sequences the jazz singer starring al jolson was released on october six one nine two seven within a year of its success most united states movie theaters had installed sound film equipment walt disney apparently intended to take advantage of this new trend and arguably managed to succeed most other cartoon studios were still producing silent products and so were unable to effectively act as competition to disney as a result mickey would soon become the most prominent animated character of the time walt disney soon worked on adding sound to both plane crazy and the <UNK> <UNK> which had originally been silent releases and their new release added to mickey s success and popularity a fourth mickey short was also put into production it was the barn dance roles mickey as a <UNK> the barn dance first released on march one four one nine two nine would be the first of twelve mickey shorts released during that year it was directed by walt disney with ub <UNK> as the head animator the barn dance of the title is the occasion which brings together minnie and her two suitors mickey and pete the latter two and their vehicles are first seen arriving at minnie s house in an attempt to pick her up for the dance mickey turns up in his horse cart while pete in a newly purchased automobile minnie initially chooses pete to drive her to the dance but the automobile unexpectedly breaks down she resorts to accepting mickey s invitation they are later seen dancing together but mickey proves to be a rather clumsy dancer as he repeatedly steps on minnie s feet she consequently turns down his invitation for a second dance she instead accepts that of pete who proves to be a better dancing partner mickey then attempts to solve his problem by placing a balloon in his shorts that apparently helps him to be light on his feet and he proceeds to ask minnie for another dance she accepts and is surprised to find his dancing skills to have apparently improved pete soon discovers mickey s trick and points it out to minnie minnie is visibly disgusted by this attempt at deception as a result she leaves mickey and resumes dancing with pete in the finale mickey is reduced to crying on the floor this short was the first to feature its three main characters as parts of a love triangle it is notable for featuring mickey turned down by minnie in favor of pete it is also an unusual appearance of the pete previously depicted as a menacing villain he is portrayed here as a well mannered gentleman in addition mickey was not depicted as a hero but as a rather ineffective young <UNK> in his sadness and crying over his failure mickey appears unusually emotional and vulnerable it has been commented however that this only serves to add to the audiences empathy for the character first <UNK> appearance ever wonder why we always wear these white gloves various characters with minor variations mickey in gloves the opry house first released on march two eight one nine two nine would be the second short released during the year it cast mickey as the owner of a small theater or opera house according to the title mickey performs a vaudeville show all by himself acts include his <UNK> of a snake <UNK> his dressing in drag and performing a belly dance his caricature of a hasidic jew and for the finale a piano performance minnie did not appear in person in this short instead a poster of her can be seen which introduces her as a member of the yankee doodle girls apparently a group of female performers the only other recurring character to appear in the short is known as kat <UNK> apparently a play on the word catnip this would be his debut he would appear in two more shorts during the year as a minor antagonist this short featured no dialogue and consequently its humor relies in a long series of visual gags the musical pieces accompanying them notably included yankee doodle and georges <UNK> s carmen more notably this short introduced mickey s gloves mickey can be seen wearing them in most of his subsequent appearances supposedly one reason for adding the white gloves was to allow audiences to distinguish the characters hands when they appeared against their bodies as both were black mickey did not appear in color until the band concert in one nine three five depiction as a regular mouse when the cat s away first released on april one one one nine two nine would be the third mickey short to be released that year it was essentially a remake of one of the alice comedies alice <UNK> by rats which had been first released on january one five one nine two six kat <UNK> makes his second appearance though his name is given as tom cat this describes his being a tom cat and the character should not be confused with the co star of the tom and jerry series he is seen getting drunk on alcoholic beverages then he leaves his house to go hunting in his absence an army of mice invade his house in search of food among them are mickey and minnie who proceed to turn this gathering into a party this short is unusual in depicting mickey and minnie as having the size and partly the behavior of regular mice the set standard both before and after this short was to depict them as having the size of a rather short human being on another note it has been commented that since this short was released during the prohibition era the alcoholic beverages would probably have been products of <UNK> mickey as a soldier firsts first encounter with horace <UNK> mickey returned to civilian life with the plow boy first released on may nine one nine two nine as the title implies he was depicted as a farmer alongside minnie he is first seen with his horse while <UNK> a field then minnie comes along with her cow she has mickey milk the cow for her as he does the cow starts licking him in an apparent sign of affection mickey does not seem pleased and replies by rolling up its muzzle with its own tongue mickey eventually manages to present minnie with a full bucket of milk and proceeds to kiss her minnie s reply to this sign of affection is knocking his head with the bucket at some point the horse is <UNK> by a bee panics and starts <UNK> by the time the horse <UNK> down again the plough has been broken in the finale mickey resorts to using a pig as a plough curiously the short is considered mainly notable for the livestock it featured minnie s cow is considered to be <UNK> cow making her second appearance and mickey s plow horse is considered to be horace <UNK> making his debut though depicted as non anthropomorphic animals during this short later that same year both would become as anthropomorphic as their former owners first speaking appearance mickey <UNK> a hot dog in the <UNK> kid one nine two nine during his first eight appearances mickey would whistle laugh cry and otherwise <UNK> express himself but he would not actually speak until his ninth appearance this short was the <UNK> kid first released on may two three one nine two nine mickey s first spoken words were hot dogs the short featured mickey selling hot dogs at a carnival much of the humor in this short came from the interaction between mickey and his hot dogs with the latter tending to act like actual dogs in relation to their owner trainer three other recurring characters of the series also appear the first of them was <UNK> cow in a cameo the second was kat <UNK> making his third and last appearance a barker at the carnival he briefly gets into an argument with mickey the third was mickey s recurring love interest minnie mouse the <UNK> dancer of the carnival having purchased one of mickey s hot dogs she is surprised to see it run away the short ends at night time mickey apparently attempts to draw minnie s attention by playing guitar singing outside her window he only manages to draw the attention of two alley cats who decide to join him and then that of an irate neighbour of minnie who starts throwing things at these three <UNK> in an attempt to silence them this marks the finale of the short first singing appearance this following mickey short to be released was mickey s <UNK> <UNK> first released on june two zero one nine two nine as the title implies mickey is depicted as the engineer in charge of an unusually anthropomorphic locomotive his only passenger seems to be minnie cast as a fiddle player for this short at some point mickey loses control of the locomotive <UNK> has another brief appearance as a cow running out of its way it was soon followed by mickey s follies first released on june two six one nine two nine the short featured a <UNK> show including various numbers a female pig singing opera is considered to be patricia pig making her only animated appearance she would be a recurring character early in mickey s comic strip series but the short is more notable for mickey s main act it has mickey singing minnie s <UNK> hoo for the first time this humorous little song is considered to have a historical importance of its own for one thing the guy they call little mickey mouse for the first time addresses an audience to explain that he has got a <UNK> who is neither fat nor skinny and proudly proclaims that she s my little minnie mouse for another this would serve as the new theme song for the series the music to the song was written by carl stalling and the lyrics by walt disney finally animation historians have pointed that it seems to be the first song with original lyrics created by walt s studio from comedy to musical the ninth mickey short to be released that year was the jazz fool first released on july five one nine two nine the title was probably intended to be reminiscent of both the jazz singer and also the singing fool first released on september one nine one nine two eight both musical films featured al jolson as their star and had proved commercially successful this film followed the originals in having minimal plot and focusing on musical performances mickey and his friend horace <UNK> the latter in his first anthropomorphic appearance are cast as the sole two performers of mickey s big road show the former plays the piano and the later the <UNK> the soundtrack of the film reportedly contained elements of both ragtime and dixieland jazz this short is considered to be representative of a change of focus early in the series the preceding shorts already featured their share of song and dance numbers as part of their comedic plots many of the following ones can better be described as animated song and dance shows with little to no plot first encounter with ghosts this was not the case however with the next mickey short to be released haunted house first released on august one one nine two nine the short begins at night time mickey is seen caught up in a storm with an umbrella serving as his only protection from the rain mickey is naturally seeking a refuge for himself he soon discovers an apparently deserted house and proceeds to enter it the door suddenly <UNK> behind him and seems to be locked mickey is somewhat <UNK> and his encounters with bats and large spiders only increase his growing fear at this point mickey finds out that the house is indeed inhabited by ghosts in skeleton form mickey has entered a haunted house the figure of the grim reaper orders him to play music to entertain them mickey is surprised but clearly too scared to argue with it skeletons are seen dancing to mickey s tune at some point mickey attempts to escape but any room he attempts to enter contains more skeletons the finale has a terrified mickey crashing through a window to escape the short is clearly similar to the skeleton dance first released on august two two one nine two nine which was the first short of the silly symphonies series both feature elements generally found in horror fiction and particularly in horror films effectively combined with music and dance a series of creative and rather morbid gags provide comedic elements the result is often described as surreal and at points impressive consequently both shorts have been considered among the highlights of their respective series and animated classics earliest adventure at sea another mickey short was released in between them wild waves first released on august one five one nine two nine mickey and minnie are featured spending a day at the beach they are at first singing and dancing at the shore but at some point minnie is swept by a wave into the sea she <UNK> and seems to start drowning mickey discovers a <UNK> placed upside down on the beach he lifts it to discover an <UNK> couple who were using the boat as their cover from <UNK> eyes mickey proceeds to place it into the water and then rows the boat forward until he reaches minnie he manages to rescue her and return her to the shore but minnie is still visibly shaken from the experience mickey starts singing the tune of rocked in the cradle of the deep in an apparent effort to cheer her up soon seals <UNK> penguins <UNK> and other water birds start dancing to mickey s tune minnie cheers up and the short ends mickey was depicted acting much like a <UNK> during the short otherwise it is only notable as the first of mickey s adventures at sea mouse in transition mickey entering the depression era the twelfth and last mickey short released during the year was jungle rhythm first released on november one five one nine two nine mickey is seen in a safari somewhere in africa he rides on an elephant and is armed with a shotgun but the later proves to be problematic soon after mickey finds himself standing in between of a lion and a bear mickey proceeds to play music to calm them down during the rest of the short various jungle animals dance to mickey s tunes the tunes vary from the previously mentioned yankee doodle and turkey in the straw to auld lang <UNK> the blue danube and aloha oe first comic strip appearance by this point mickey had appeared in fifteen commercially successful animated shorts and was easily recognized by the public so walt disney was approached by king features syndicate with the offer to licence mickey and his supporting characters for use in a comic strip walt accepted and mickey made his first comic strip appearance on january one three one nine three zero the comical plot was credited to walt disney himself art to ub <UNK> and <UNK> to win smith the first week or so of the strip featured a loose adaptation of plane crazy minnie soon became the first addition to the cast the strips first released between january one three and march three one one nine three zero have been occasionally reprinted in comic book form under the collective title lost on a desert island classical music performances meanwhile in animation two more mickey shorts had been released the first of them was the <UNK> concert first released on march three one nine three zero it featured mickey conducting an orchestra the only recurring characters among its members were <UNK> as a flutist and horace as a drummer their rendition of the poet and peasant is humorous enough but it has been noted that several of the gags featured were repeated from previous shorts the second was originally released on march one four one nine three zero under the title <UNK> around but has since been renamed to just mickey both titles give an accurate enough description of the short which has mickey performing a violin solo it is only notable for mickey s emotional renditions of the finale to the william tell overture robert schumann s tr <UNK> <UNK> and franz liszt s hungarian rhapsody no two departure of a co creator and consequences the opening title card of steamboat willie credits both walt disney and ub <UNK> they were followed by cactus kid first released on april one one one nine three zero as the title implies the short was intended as a western movie parody but it is considered to be more or less a remake of the <UNK> <UNK> set in mexico instead of argentina mickey was again cast as a lonely traveler who walks into the local tavern and starts flirting with its dancer the latter is again minnie the rival <UNK> to mickey is again pete though using the alias peg leg pedro for the first time in a mickey short pete was depicted as having a peg leg this would become a recurring feature of the character the rhea of the original short was replaced by horace <UNK> this is considered to be his last non anthropomorphic appearance the short is considered significant for being the last mickey short to be animated by ub <UNK> shortly before its release <UNK> had left the studio in an attempt to create his own the result of his early efforts was the flip the frog series his departure is considered to mark a turning point to the careers of both walt disney and mickey mouse the former lost the man who served as his closest colleague and confidant since one nine one nine the latter lost the man responsible for his original design and for the direction and or animation of several of the shorts released till this point and some would argue mickey s creator walt disney has been credited for the inspiration to create mickey but <UNK> was the one to design the character and the first few mickey mouse cartoons were mostly or entirely drawn by <UNK> consequently some animation historians have suggested that <UNK> should be considered the actual creator of mickey mouse it has been pointed that advertising for the early mickey mouse cartoons credit them as a walt disney comic drawn by ub <UNK> later disney company <UNK> of the early cartoons tend to credit walt disney alone in any case walt and his remaining staff continued the production of the mickey series mickey continued to appear regularly in animated shorts until one nine four three and again from one nine four six to one nine five three but back in early one nine three zero walt had another matter to attend to the creation of the comic strip after <UNK> departure at first walt was content to continue scripting it and assigning the art to win smith however walt s focus had always been in animation and smith was soon assigned with the scripting as well win smith was apparently discontent at having to script draw and ink a series by himself this became evident by his sudden resignation another reason might be that walt disney was a very impossible man and win smith got sick of this lack of freedom to create in walt proceeded to search for a replacement to smith among the remaining staff of the studio for uncertain reasons he chose floyd <UNK> a recently hired employee at the time floyd was reportedly eager to work in animation and somewhat reluctant to accept his new assignment walt had to assure floyd that the assignment was only temporary and that he would eventually return to animation floyd accepted and ended up holding this temporary assignment from may five one nine three zero to november one five one nine seven five appearances in comics floyd at first had to work on the continuation of a storyline which his predecessors had started on april one one nine three zero the storyline was completed on september two zero one nine three zero and was later reprinted in comic book form as mickey mouse in death valley this early adventure contributed to the extension of the comic strip cast which by this point only included mickey and minnie this story would bring the first comic strip appearances of <UNK> cow horace <UNK> and black pete as well as the debuts of corrupted lawyer sylvester <UNK> and minnie s uncle mortimer mouse the story was followed by mr <UNK> and the egg robbers first printed between september two two and december two six one nine three zero which introduced marcus mouse and his wife as minnie s parents starting with these two early comic strip stories mickey s versions in animation and comics are considered to have diverged from each other while disney and his cartoon shorts would continue to focus on comedy the comic strip effectively combined comedy and adventure this adventurous version of mickey would continue to appear in comic strips and later comic books throughout the two zero th and into the two one st century mickey was the main character for the series mm mickey mouse <UNK> magazine published in italy from one nine nine nine to two zero zero one later mickey history one nine three zero one nine five zero a typical style of sign in walt disney world showing one of many uses by disney of the mickey ears logo in his earliest cartoons mickey was often mischievous and the cartoons sometimes used <UNK> humor as the series became more popular disney decided to change his best known character into a well meaning everyman and creating mischief was thereafter left to other characters in one nine three five mickey mouse appeared in color for the first time in the band concert widely considered his best film he is eclipsed somewhat by donald duck who appeared in color before mickey in one nine three four s the wise little hen following two more black and white shorts mickey s service station and mickey s kangaroo also released in one nine three five every other disney cartoon was made in color the band concert somewhat marks the end of mickey as a leading cartoon star the disney studio had a hard time coming up with stories for mickey mickey s service station in one nine three five started a formula that would dominate the mickey cartoons the trio format these cartoons would put mickey donald and goofy together allowing donald and goofy to handle most of the gags the studio realized that while mickey mouse is a very appealing character he is not all that funny once in a while the disney studio would find a perfect vehicle for mickey thru the mirror one nine three six mickey s rival one nine three six the brave little tailor one nine three eight and the <UNK> nineties one nine four one are all good examples of mickey at his best probably his best film appearance was the popular segment the sorcerer s <UNK> in disney s fantasia one nine four zero throughout the four zero s mickey made fewer and fewer films until his last film the simple things in one nine five three mickey would not return to theatres until one nine eight three with the release of mickey s christmas carol from one nine three zero until one nine five zero though the numbers of the comic creators that worked on mickey increased the most popular version considered the classic version today was that of floyd <UNK> who developed mickey s character adopted characters from the cartoons and created many others since one nine five zero the most popular version of mickey has been that of italian creator romano <UNK> who has further developed <UNK> s characters and has added many of his own mickey s most well known supporting characters are his girlfriend minnie mouse his dog pluto and his best friends goofy and donald duck by his sister amelia <UNK> mickey mouse has two nephews the lesser known <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> in contrast to donald duck s famous nephews huey dewey and louie in one nine two nine disney created the original mickey mouse club for fans of his character and cartoons which later formed the basis for a popular one nine five zero s television show with follow ups of the same name in one nine seven seven and one nine eight nine mickey has only starred in two feature films the sorcerer s <UNK> segment in fantasia and the mickey and the beanstalk segment of fun and fancy free one nine four seven he has also starred in two half hour theatrical <UNK> mickey s christmas carol one nine eight three screened in front of a re issue of the <UNK> and the prince and the pauper one nine nine zero screened in front of the <UNK> down under for many years mickey mouse has served as the mascot for the walt disney company alongside <UNK> cricket and <UNK> recent history mickey and friends run a nightclub together in disney s house of mouse on november one eight one nine seven eight in honor of his five zero th anniversary he became the first cartoon character to have a star on the hollywood walk of fame the star is located on six nine two five hollywood blvd throughout the decades mickey mouse competed with warner bros bugs bunny for animated popularity but in one nine eight eight in a historic moment in motion picture history the two rivals finally shared screen time in the robert <UNK> film who framed roger rabbit warner and disney signed an agreement stating that each character had exactly the same amount of screen time right down to the semi second only three people have regularly provided the voice for mickey not including theme park attractions and parades walt disney from one nine two eight to one nine four seven james macdonald from one nine four eight to one nine eight three and currently wayne <UNK> who first voiced the mouse in mickey s christmas carol in one nine eight three his most recent theatrical cartoon was one nine

out on game boy advance as well as disney s magical quest two and disney s magical quest three other video games released in this period were disney s magical mirror and disney s hide speculated his cigarette habit had damaged his voice over the years and during the recording of the mickey and the beanstalk section of fun and fancy free mickey s voice was handed over to veteran disney musician and actor jim macdonald both disney s and macdonald s voices can be heard on the final soundtrack macdonald voiced mickey in the remainder of the theatrical shorts and for various television and publicity projects up until his retirement in the mid one nine seven zero s although walt voiced mickey again for the introductions of the original one nine five four one nine five nine mickey mouse

on a particular ballot or to highlight the <UNK> of a particular voting procedure since most states electoral systems do not provide for blank balloting or a choice of none of the above most protest votes take the form of a clearly non serious candidate s name entered as a write in vote cartoon characters are typically chosen for this purpose as mickey mouse is the most well known and well recognized character in america his name is frequently selected for this purpose other popular selections include donald duck and bugs bunny this phenomenon has the humorous effect of causing mickey mouse to be a minor but perennial <UNK> of nearly all u s presidential elections a similar phenomenon occurs in the parliament elections in finland and sweden although finns and swedes usually write donald duck or donald duck party as a protest vote as donald is more popular than mickey in these countries pejorative use of mickey s name mickey mouse is a slang expression meaning small time <UNK>

are receptive to this voice i speak man s inability to live god s words makes the avatar s teaching a mockery instead of practicing the compassion he taught man has waged wars in his name instead of living the humility purity and truth of his words man has given way to hatred greed and violence because man has been deaf to the principles and precepts laid down by god in the past in this present <UNK> form i observe silence first contacts with the west in the one nine three zero s <UNK> baba began a period of extensive world travel circling the globe many times he made frequent trips to england europe and america it was during this period that he established contact with his first close group of western disciples on his first trip to england in one nine three one he travelled on the ss <UNK> the same ship as mahatma gandhi <UNK> baba and gandhi had many private conversations in the west <UNK> baba met with interested individuals who had heard of his spiritual status and his work in india many of whom were notable celebrities and artists such as hollywood stars gary cooper <UNK> <UNK> mary pickford and douglas fairbanks jr he enjoyed watching chaplin movies comparing creation to movie making in the late three zero s <UNK> baba invited a group of western women to join him in india where he arranged a series of trips that became known as the blue bus tours when they returned home many newspapers treated their journey as an occasion for scandal baba s image on one of his many books the discourses during the course of early gatherings of his <UNK> disciples and followers <UNK> baba would give discourses on different spiritual subjects between one nine three eight and one nine four three <UNK> baba dictated a series of discourses on his alphabet board these discourses transcribed by close disciples address all aspects of the spiritual life and provide practical and simple direction for the <UNK> during those years at least one of these discourses appeared in each

published between one nine three nine and one nine five four in india a five volume compilation titled discourses received several printings in one nine six seven two years before passing away <UNK> baba personally supervised the editing and publication of a new three volume version of the discourses known as the sixth edition which is available online the widely available seventh edition of the discourses first published by <UNK> press in one nine eight seven after baba s death contains numerous editorial changes not specifically authorized by <UNK> baba work with masts in the one nine four zero s <UNK> baba did extensive work with a category of people he termed masts short for mast allah meaning intoxicated with god these individuals are essentially disabled by their <UNK> experience of the higher spiritual planes although outwardly masts appear irrational or even insane <UNK> baba claimed that their spiritual status was actually quite elevated and that by meeting with them he allowed them to move forward spiritually <UNK> baba visited literally thousands of masts throughout the world and occasionally set up <UNK> where they were cared for the best known of these masts known as muhammad mast lived at <UNK> baba s encampment at <UNK> until his death in two zero zero three this work with masts was extensively documented in a book by one of <UNK> baba s western followers the <UNK> <UNK> baba with the god intoxicated by william <UNK> isbn zero nine one three zero seven eight six five four the new life in one nine four nine <UNK> baba began an enigmatic period which he called the new life following a series of questions on their readiness to obey even the most difficult of his requests <UNK> baba selected two zero companions to join him in a life of complete <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> during this time <UNK> baba acted not as the master but as a companion he made provisions for those dependent on him then he and his companions otherwise gave up all property and financial responsibilities they then traveled about india <UNK> without money begging for their food carrying out baba s instructions and living in strict accordance with a set of conditions of the new life these included absolute acceptance of the circumstances of their life and consistent good cheer in the face of any difficulty those companions who failed to comply were sent away automobile accident in u s a <UNK> baba ended the new life after a period of intense seclusion and once again began a round of public appearances and extensive travel throughout india and the west in the early one nine five zero s <UNK> baba established two centers outside of india <UNK> spiritual center in myrtle beach south carolina and avatar s abode near brisbane australia on may two

issued a number of messages and discourses the most significant being <UNK> baba s call in october of one nine five four <UNK> baba discarded his alphabet board and began using a unique set of hand gestures to communicate in one nine five six he visited myrtle beach and other places in the us as well as the newly opened avatar s abode in australia automobile accident in india in late one nine five six outside <UNK> india the car in which <UNK> baba was travelling went out of control and a serious accident occurred <UNK> baba suffered a fractured pelvis and other severe injuries dr <UNK> a close <UNK> was killed this accident seriously incapacitated <UNK> baba despite his physician s predictions to the contrary after great effort baba managed to walk again but from that point was in constant pain and was severely limited in his ability to move <UNK> baba made one more trip to the west in one nine five eight on this visit he often needed to be carried from venue to venue seclusion and east west gathering <UNK> baba returned to india and began more periods of fasting meditation and seclusion one might have expected such seclusion to be <UNK> on the contrary <UNK> baba s seclusion work was draining and exhausting he claimed to be doing work on behalf of the spiritual welfare of all humanity in one nine six two <UNK> baba gave one of his last public functions a series of meetings he called the east west gathering at these meetings at which his western followers were invited to meet his indian disciples baba gave <UNK> to many thousands despite the physical strain this caused on his broken body god in a pill in one nine six six at the height of the psychedelic era <UNK> baba allowed individual visits by three young western academics who asked about the spiritual aspects of drugs in response <UNK> baba s words were collected in a pamphlet god in a pill in which he stated that drug use was spiritually damaging saying that if <UNK> were possible through drugs then god is not worthy of being god at his request the three returned to the west and spread this message which increased <UNK> baba s notoriety among the young it was during this period that the popular poster of a smiling baba <UNK> don t worry be happy became widely distributed even appearing in day <UNK> versions final seclusion and <UNK> from the east west gathering onward <UNK> baba s health deteriorated steadily despite the physical toll they took on his body <UNK> baba spent long periods in seclusion fasting and meditating his physical condition grew steadily worse in one nine six eight <UNK> baba completed a particularly taxing period of seclusion and emerged saying that his work was completed one zero zero to my satisfaction by this point he was confined to a wheelchair within a few months his condition worsened and he was bed ridden his body <UNK> by intense muscular <UNK> that had no clear origin despite the care of several doctors the <UNK> grew progressively worse on january three one one nine six nine <UNK> baba took his final <UNK> conveying by his final gesture do not forget that i am god this day became known as <UNK> <UNK> day <UNK> baba s body was laid in his <UNK> amongst ice and sawdust and covered with roses it was kept available to the public for one week before its final burial <UNK> baba s portrait on a book by josephine esther ross last <UNK> before his passing <UNK> baba had made extensive preparations for a public <UNK> program to be held in pune india his <UNK> decided to proceed with the arrangements despite the physical absence of the host saying that god had invited them and they were free to keep their appointment several thousands attended this last <UNK> including many hundred young people from the us england and australia who had been affected by <UNK> baba s anti drug message and by his other teachings cosmology his cosmology which has echoes of sufism and vedanta as well as christian mysticism is summarized in the one nine five four book god speaks much of which <UNK> baba dictated using an english language alphabet board he personally recommended the book to a number of his followers saying it was the most important book for this age evolution and involution <UNK> baba s cosmology is based on divine unity the concept that diverse creation or duality is an illusion i tell you all with my divine authority that you and i are not we but one the oneness of reality is so <UNK> unlimited and all pervading that not only we are one but even this collective term of we has no place in the infinite indivisible oneness <UNK> baba says that the goal of life is conscious realization of the absolute oneness of god <UNK> baba s work as avatar is to awaken this oneness in each heart <UNK> baba compares god to an infinite <UNK> ocean which has only unconscious divinity unaware of itself because there is nothing but itself to become aware of its divinity the ocean formed drops of itself called drop souls each asking the question who am i in pursuit of the answer to gain conscious divinity each drop soul evolves through experience of each form in the seven kingdoms of evolution these are stone or metal vegetable worm fish bird animal and human the drop soul experiences and discards forms in all these kingdoms accumulating <UNK> or impressions the final form of the soul s evolution is human only human consciousness can achieve awareness of divinity according to <UNK> baba during its evolution however the drop soul also accumulates numerous false <UNK> which prevent the drop soul from automatically realizing its true identity as god ocean once it attains human form to gain its true identity the drop soul traverses an inward spiritual path called involution which gradually eliminates all false <UNK> of <UNK> from god ocean once the false <UNK> are gone the goal of knowing itself as conscious divinity is attained the drop soul once again becomes merged in the ocean it is has now answered the question of who am i with i am god the first drop soul to answer this question is the avatar he is responsible for each drop soul after him <UNK> as the drop soul progresses through lifetimes it becomes shaped by the impressions or <UNK> picked up by the three forms or bodies it is now associated with the gross body the subtle body and the mental body these three bodies form the individual s consciousness and it is this consciousness which is bound by <UNK> the drop soul is never bound <UNK> are described as binding or <UNK> natural or unnatural actions such as murder create unnatural binding <UNK> even good actions can create binding <UNK> eating for example is a natural <UNK> but <UNK> is unnatural <UNK> are <UNK> and so there is no way of determining the effect of a particular action an action may be good in one instance and bad in another based on the person s intent the law of karma cause and effect balances good and bad actions and their subsequent <UNK> inevitably the individual seeks a life of love for god which is beyond the duality of good and bad this inward journey towards god gradually awakens consciousness until the grace of a perfect master <UNK> all <UNK> out <UNK> baba stated the wiping out of <UNK> can be effected only by the grace of a perfect master the avatar according to <UNK> baba is the eternal living perfect master the avatar <UNK> baba claimed to be the avatar a sanskrit word meaning descent of god the ancient soul who is literally god in human form <UNK> baba stated that the avatar is the being of beings the same ancient soul taking birth in human form every seven zero zero to one four zero zero years <UNK> baba s followers believe that the avatar <UNK> in this cycle of time as zoroaster rama krishna the buddha jesus and muhammad some followers believe that abraham is also the avatar <UNK> in a previous cycle of time <UNK> <UNK> one of baba s closest disciples stated that he believes that noah was the avatar role of the avatar <UNK> baba describes the avatar as a gauge against which man can measure what he is and what he may become he <UNK> the standard of human values by interpreting them in terms of divinely human life in spiritual terms the avatar awakens all souls towards their true identity as god <UNK> baba stated in his own way the avatar <UNK> fulfills his incarnation by giving a spiritual push to his age the avatar helps each individual to break free from his or her bondage in his or her own way in practical terms the avatar lives a human life which provides for future generations a model for compassionate thoughts words and deeds while the avatar is omnipotent and omniscient he completely inhabits his human form and lives for the most part within a human body s constraints in some situations however he may make use of his infinite power knowledge or bliss as jesus christ the avatar made use of powers on the four th plane of consciousness the plane of miracles this power could have also prevented him from horrific torture however he used his powers to have those events occur in order to benefit all of creation for more information on <UNK> baba s concept of the planes of consciousness one may refer to his book god speaks followers of <UNK> baba <UNK> baba traveled around the world several times attracting followers on all continents although he sometimes participated in large public gatherings <UNK> baba discouraged his followers from proselytizing on his behalf rather he stated let your life itself be my message of love and truth to others the silent master p one seven there are no special requirements rites or rituals associated with becoming a follower of <UNK> baba nor are there any specific duties rites or rituals required of his followers many of baba s followers observe a few common practices however gatherings of baba followers when they occur are typically informal and highly social in nature special effort will be made to gather together on <UNK> the anniversary of <UNK> baba s death and on his birthday most of <UNK> baba s followers observe silence day on july one zero of each year by keeping verbal silence for two four hours in accordance with the requests baba often made during his life that his followers keep silence or fast on this day three prayers written by <UNK> baba o <UNK> the prayer of repentance and the beloved god prayer are repeated morning and evening at his <UNK> and are often repeated at gatherings of his followers at <UNK> his followers maintain <UNK> baba s practice of

commonly found in the microwave oven as well as various radar applications construction and operation <UNK> with section removed magnet is not shown all cavity <UNK> consist of a hot filament cathode kept at or pulsed to a high negative potential by a high voltage direct current power supply the cathode is built into the center of an evacuated <UNK> circular chamber a perpendicular magnetic field is imposed by a permanent magnet the magnetic field causes the electrons attracted to the relatively positive outer part of the chamber to spiral outward in a circular path rather than moving directly to this anode spaced about the rim of the chamber are cylindrical cavities the cavities are open along their length and so connect the common cavity space as electrons sweep past these openings they induce a resonant high frequency radio field in the cavity which in turn causes the electrons to bunch into groups a portion of this field is extracted with a short antenna that is connected to a <UNK> a metal tube usually of rectangular cross section the <UNK> directs the extracted rf energy to the load which may be a cooking chamber in a microwave oven or a high gain antenna in the case of radar a cross sectional diagram of a resonant cavity <UNK> the size of the cavities determine the resonant frequency and so the frequency of the emitted microwaves the frequency is thus not precisely controllable which is not a problem in many applications such as heating or some forms of radar where the receiver can be synchronised with the <UNK> output where precise frequencies are required other devices such as the <UNK> are used the voltage applied and the characteristics of the cathode determine the power of the device the <UNK> is a fairly efficient device in a microwave oven for instance a one one zero zero watt input will generally create about seven zero zero watts of microwave energy an efficiency around six five this is far more efficient than the <UNK> which typically operates around three zero modern solid state microwave sources typically operate around two five to three zero and are used primarily because they can generate a wide range of frequencies thus the <UNK> remains in widespread use in roles where precise frequency control is not important applications <UNK> with magnet in its mounting box the horizontal plates aid in cooling the device by airflow from a fan radar see also history of radar <UNK> in radar devices the <UNK> is connected to an antenna which may be a <UNK> <UNK> or a conical <UNK> pointing into a parabolic reflector the <UNK> is operated with very short high intensity pulses of applied voltage resulting in a short pulse of microwave energy being emitted a small portion of this energy is reflected back to the antenna and the <UNK> where it is directed to a sensitive receiver with further signal processing the signal is ultimately displayed as a radar map on a cathode ray tube crt or a liquid crystal display heating in microwave ovens the <UNK> leads to a radio frequency transparent port into the cooking chamber it is important that there be food in the oven when it is operated so that these waves are absorbed

an urgent need during radar development in world war ii for a high power microwave generator that worked in shorter wavelengths around one zero cm rather than one five zero cm available from tube based generators of the time it was known that a multi cavity resonant <UNK> had been developed in one nine three five by hans <UNK> in berlin however the german military considered its frequency drift to be undesirable and based their radar systems on the <UNK> instead it was primarily for this reason that german night fighter radars were never a match for their british counterparts in one

during world war ii in microwave radar equipment and is often credited with giving allied radar a considerable performance advantage over german and japanese radars thus directly influencing the outcome of the war short wave <UNK> radar which was made possible by the cavity <UNK> allowed for the detection of much smaller objects and the use of much smaller antennas the combination of the small sized cavity <UNK> small antennas and high resolution allowed small high quality radars to be installed in aircraft they could be used by maritime patrol aircraft to detect objects as small as a

allied bombers used in the strategic bombing campaign <UNK> gun laying radars were likewise far more accurate than the older technology they made the big gunned allied battleships more deadly and

<UNK> and <UNK> common woodland <UNK> and meadow <UNK> or <UNK> describes the organization of rural economy and society in medieval western and parts of central europe characterised by the <UNK> of legal and economic power in a lord supported economically from his own direct <UNK> and from the obligatory contributions of a legally subject part of the peasant population under his jurisdiction these obligations could be payable in labour the french term <UNK> e is conventionally applied produce in kind or rarely money the word derives from the inherited traditional divisions of the countryside reassigned as local jurisdictions known as <UNK> or <UNK> each subject to a lord french <UNK> usually holding his position in return for undertakings offered to a higher lord see feudalism the lord held a manor court governed by public law and local custom not all territorial <UNK> were secular bishops and abbots held lands that entailed similar obligations in the generic plan of a medieval manor from shepherd s historical atlas illustration right the strips of individually worked land in the open field system are immediately apparent in this plan the manor house is set slightly apart from the village conferring the privacy that has been more a concern since the one eight th century than it was in medieval times equally often the village grew up around the <UNK> of the manor formerly walled while the <UNK> of the manor stretched away outside as still may be seen at <UNK> house and other english houses with a village front and a park front and most commonly in italy to the contrary when a grand new house was required by the new owner of <UNK> manor lincolnshire in the one eight three zero s the site of the existing manor house at the edge of its village was abandoned for the new <UNK> <UNK> manor isolated in its park with the village out of view the conditions of land tenure underlie all social or economic factors in an agrarian society two legal systems of pre <UNK> <UNK> obtained one the most common was the system of holding land <UNK> in full outright ownership the other was a use of <UNK> or <UNK> in which land was held <UNK> giving us our word precarious to these two systems the carolingian monarchs added a third the <UNK> which linked <UNK> with feudalism the <UNK> made its first appearance in charlemagne s province of <UNK> in the south of france when charlemagne had to settle the visigothic refugees who had fled with his retreating forces after the failure of his <UNK> expedition of seven seven eight he solved this problem by <UNK> desert tracts of <UNK> land belonging to the royal fisc under direct control of the emperor these holdings <UNK> entailed specific conditions the earliest specific <UNK> grant that has been identified was at <UNK> near narbonne see lewis links in certain areas of the former empire of the west a system of villas was entrenched in late antiquity and was inherited by the medieval world common features <UNK> each consisted of up to three classes of land <UNK> the part controlled immediately by the lord and exploited directly for the benefit of his household and dependents dependent <UNK> or <UNK> holdings carrying the obligation that the peasant household supply the lord with specified labour services or a part of its output or cash in lieu thereof subject to the custom attached to the holding and free peasant land without such obligation but otherwise subject to <UNK> jurisdiction and custom and owing money rent fixed at the time of the lease additional sources of income from the lord included charges for use of his mill bakery or wine press or for the right to hunt or to let pigs feed in his woodland as well as court revenues and single payments on each change of tenant on the other side of the account <UNK> administration involved significant expenses perhaps a reason why smaller <UNK> tended to rely less on <UNK> tenure <UNK> holdings were held nominally by arrangement of lord and tenant but tenure became in practice almost universally hereditary with a payment being made to the lord on the succession of another member of the family <UNK> land could not be abandoned at least until demographic and economic circumstances made flight a viable proposition nor could they be passed to a third party without the lord s permission and the customary payment though not free <UNK> were by no means in the same position as slaves they enjoyed legal rights subject to local custom and had recourse to the law subject to court charges which were an additional source of <UNK> income sub letting of <UNK> holdings was not uncommon and labour on the <UNK> might be commuted into an additional money payment as happened increasingly from the one three th century this description of a manor house at <UNK> essex in england was recorded in a document for the chapter of st paul s cathedral when it was granted to robert le moyne in one two six five he received also a sufficient

development with changing economic conditions not all <UNK> contained all three kinds of land as an average <UNK> accounted for roughly a third of the arable area and <UNK> holdings rather more but

smaller <UNK> <UNK> varied similarly in their geographical arrangement most did not coincide with a single village but rather consisted of parts of two or more villages most of the latter containing also parts of at least one other manor this situation sometimes led to the replacement by cash payments of the <UNK> labour obligations of those peasants living furthest from the lord s estate as was the case with peasant plots the <UNK> was not a single territorial unit but consisted rather of a central house with neighbouring land and estate buildings plus strips dispersed through the manor alongside free and <UNK> ones in addition the lord might lease free <UNK> belonging to neighbouring <UNK> as well as holding other <UNK> some distance away to provide a greater range of produce nor

area than neighbouring lay <UNK> the effect of circumstances on <UNK> economy is complex and at times contradictory upland conditions have been seen as tending to preserve peasant freedoms livestock husbandry in particular being less labour intensive and therefore less demanding of <UNK> services on the other hand some such areas of europe have been said to show some of the most oppressive <UNK> conditions while lowland eastern england is credited with an exceptionally large free peasantry in part a legacy of scandinavian settlement similarly the spread of money economy is often seen as having stimulated the replacement of labour services by money payments but the growth of the money supply and resulting inflation after one one seven zero initially led nobles to take back leased estates and to re impose labour dues as the value of fixed cash payments declined in real terms historical development and geographical distribution the term is most often used with reference to medieval western europe antecedents of the system can be traced to the rural economy of the later roman empire with a declining birthrate and population the key factor of production was labour

the roman landlord was often simply replaced by the barbarian with little change to the underlying situation the process of rural self sufficiency was given an abrupt boost in the eighth century when normal trade in the mediterranean sea was disrupted the thesis put forward by henri <UNK> disputed by many supposes that the arab conquests forced the medieval economy into even greater <UNK> and gave

atlanta at the request of her friend who now worked for latham latham was enchanted with mitchell and asked her if she had ever written a book mitchell <UNK> she was too professional to even dream of showing her old <UNK> manuscript to a publisher well if you ever do write a book please show it to me first latham <UNK> later that day a friend of mitchell s having heard this conversation laughed imagine anyone as silly as peggy writing a book she said mitchell stewed over this comment went home and found most of the old crumbling envelopes containing her disjointed manuscript which she had

back it was too late latham had read enough pages of the disjointed disintegrating manuscript to realize he had a blockbuster instead of returning the manuscript he wrote to her of his thoughts on the

metamorphosis is a process in biology by which an individual physically develops after birth or hatching and involves significant change in form as well as growth and differentiation it usually accompanies a change of habitat or of habits but may occur without such change it was once thought that in those cases where the animal s habitat remains unchanged metamorphosis followed a series of forms representing evolutionary ancestors of the species in question see <UNK> <UNK> phylogeny but this is no longer thought to be true the first type of metamorphosis is illustrated by many insects and by amphibians immature <UNK> are aquatic though the adults are flying insects and frogs undergo a metamorphosis from an aquatic <UNK> to an amphibious adult form change of habits is illustrated by the transformation of the free swimming young of many aquatic invertebrates into <UNK> adults eg sea <UNK> and the development of butterflies and moths from caterpillars with chewing <UNK> into flying insects with sucking <UNK> the second type is illustrated by many <UNK> species whose young undergo significant physical metamorphosis without changing habits or habitat significantly the immature stages of a species that undergoes metamorphosis are designated by the term larva in the complex metamorphosis of many insect species however only the first stage is called a larva and sometimes even that bears a different name the distinction depends upon the nature of the metamorphosis some insects hatch from the egg already having the general form of the adult and the metamorphosis to adult form is usually marked mainly by the development of wings this type of metamorphosis is called simple gradual or incomplete metamorphosis <UNK> and the young are called nymphs or <UNK> when aquatic it is often found in the order <UNK> or genus <UNK> which is commonly known as the praying mantis they do not undergo stages like a caterpillar to a butterfly instead they undergo several stages where the nymph of e g a praying mantis looks like a smaller sized wingless adult and ends the metamorphosis with fully developed wings insects with complete metamorphosis pass through a larval stage and then enter an inactive state known as a <UNK> or <UNK> finally emerging as the adult form a number of beetle species and <UNK> undergo <UNK> with a sequence of different larval forms preceding <UNK> whether the insect spends more time in its adult stage or in its juvenile form depends on the individual species notable examples of the latter are the <UNK> whose non eating adult stage lives as

historical figures portrayed by shakespeare in computer networking the term maximum transmission unit mtu refers to the size in bytes of the largest datagram that a given layer of a communications protocol can pass onwards mtu parameters usually appear in association with a communications interface nic serial port etc theory the internet protocol allows ip fragmentation allowing a datagram to sub divide into pieces each small enough to pass over a link with a smaller mtu than the original datagram size this fragmentation takes place at the ip layer osi layer three and uses the mtu parameter of the network interface that will send the packet out onto the link the fragmentation process marks the fragments of the original packet so that the ip layer of the destination host can <UNK> the packets into the original datagram the internet protocol defines the path mtu of an internet transmission path as the smallest mtu of any of the ip hops of the path from the source address to the destination address or looked at another way the path mtu defines the largest mtu value that can traverse the path without the packets <UNK> further fragmentation rfc one one nine one describes path mtu discovery a technique for determining the path mtu between two ip hosts with a view to avoiding ip fragmentation this technique makes use of feedback to the source address of the results of sending gradually increasing datagram sizes with the df don t fragment bit set any device along the path that needs to fragment the packet will drop the packet instead and send an icmp datagram too big response back to the source address through this probing the source host learns the largest mtu that can pass that path without <UNK> potential problems and troubleshooting unfortunately increasing numbers of networks block all icmp traffic e g to prevent denial of service attacks this prevents path mtu discovery from working one often detects such blocking in the cases where a connection works for low volume data but hangs as soon as a host sends a large block of data at a time for example with irc a client might see up to the <UNK> ping but get no response after that as the large set of welcome messages freezes up the connection also in an internet protocol network the path from the source address to the destination address often gets modified dynamically in response to various events load balancing congestion <UNK> etc this could result in the path mtu changing sometimes repeatedly during a transmission which may introduce further packet drops before the host finds the new safe mtu most modern ethernet lans use an mtu of one five zero zero bytes but systems like <UNK> will reduce this causing path mtu discovery to come into effect with the possible effect of making some sites behind badly configured firewalls unreachable one can possibly work around this depending on which part of the network one controls for example one can change the <UNK> maximum segment size in the initial packet that sets up the tcp connection at one s firewall to do so in a linux router <UNK> i forward p tcp m tcp tcp flags syn rst syn j <UNK> clamp <UNK> to <UNK> some ibm

behavior originally the term computer virus was used for a program which infected other executable software while a worm transmitted itself over a network to infect computers more recently the words are often used interchangeably today some draw the distinction between viruses and worms by saying that a virus requires user intervention to spread whereas a worm spreads automatically this means that infections transmitted by email which rely on the recipient opening an attachment to infect the system are classed as viruses capsule history of viruses and worms main articles computer virus computer worm before internet access became widespread viruses spread on personal computers by infecting programs or the executable boot sectors of floppy disks by inserting a copy of itself into the machine code instructions in these executables a virus causes itself to be run whenever the program is run or the disk is booted early computer viruses were written for the apple ii and macintosh but they became more widespread with the dominance of the ibm pc and ms dos system executable infecting viruses are dependent on users exchanging software or boot floppies so they spread heavily in computer hobbyist circles the first worms network borne infectious programs originated not on personal computers but on multitasking unix systems the first well known worm was the internet worm of one nine eight eight which infected <UNK> and vax bsd systems unlike a virus this worm did not insert itself into other programs rather it exploited security holes in network server programs and started itself running as a separate process this same behavior is used by today s worms as well with the rise of the microsoft windows platform in the one nine nine zero s and the flexible macro systems of its applications it became possible to write infectious code in the macro language of microsoft word and similar programs these macro viruses infect documents and templates rather than applications but rely on the fact that macros in a word document are a form of executable code today worms are most commonly written for the windows os although a small number are also written for linux and other unix systems worms today work in the same basic way as one nine eight eight s internet worm they scan the network for computers with vulnerable network services break in to those computers and copy themselves over worm outbreaks have become a cyclical plague for both home users and businesses eclipsed recently in terms of damage by spyware concealment trojan horses and <UNK> for a malicious program to accomplish its goals it must be able to do so without being shut down by the user or administrator of the computer it s on concealment can also help get the malware installed in the first place by <UNK> a malicious program as something innocuous or desirable users may be tempted to install it without knowing what it does this is the technique of the trojan horse or trojan broadly speaking a trojan horse is any program that invites the user to run it but conceals a harmful or malicious payload the payload may take effect immediately and can lead to many undesirable effects such as deleting all the user s files or more commonly it may install further harmful software into the user s system to serve the creator s longer term goals trojan horses known as <UNK> are used to start off a worm outbreak by injecting the worm into users local networks one of the most common ways that spyware is distributed is as a trojan horse bundled with a piece of desirable software that the user downloads off the web or a peer to peer file trading network when the user installs the software the spyware is installed alongside spyware authors who attempt to act legally may include an end user license agreement which states the behavior of the spyware in loose terms but with the knowledge that users are unlikely to read or understand it once a malicious program is installed on a system it is often useful to the creator if it stays concealed the same is true when a human attacker breaks into a computer directly techniques known as <UNK> allow this concealment by modifying the host operating system so that the malware is hidden from the user <UNK> can prevent a malicious process from being reported in the process table or keep its files from being read originally a <UNK> was a set of tools installed by a human attacker on a unix system where the attacker had gained administrator root access today the term is used more generally for concealment routines in a malicious program malware for profit spyware <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> during the one nine eight zero s and one nine nine zero s it was usually taken for granted that malicious programs were created as a form of vandalism or prank more recently the greater share of malware programs have been written with a financial or profit motive in mind this can be taken as the malware authors choice to <UNK> their control over infected systems to turn that control into a source of revenue since two zero zero three or so the most costly form of malware in terms of time and money spent in recovery has been the broad category known as spyware spyware programs are commercially produced for the purpose of gathering information about computer users showing them pop up ads and altering web browser behavior to financially benefit the spyware creator for instance some spyware programs redirect search engine results to pages full of paid advertisements others deemed <UNK> by the media <UNK> affiliate marketing codes so that the revenue goes to the spyware creator rather than a legitimate web site owner spyware programs are usually installed as trojan horses of one sort or another they differ in that their creators present themselves openly as businesses for instance by selling advertising space on the pop ups created by the malware most such programs present the user with an end user license agreement which purportedly protects the creator from prosecution under computer <UNK> laws however spyware <UNK> have not yet been upheld in court another way that financially motivated malware creator can <UNK> their infections is to directly use the infected computers to do work for the creator <UNK> viruses such as the <UNK> and <UNK> virus families are commissioned by e mail spam gangs the infected computers are used as proxies to send out spam messages the advantage to <UNK> of using infected computers is that they are available in large supply thanks to the virus and they provide anonymity protecting the <UNK> from prosecution <UNK> have also used infected pcs to target anti spam organizations with distributed denial of service attacks in order to coordinate the activity of many infected computers attackers have used coordinating systems known as <UNK> in a <UNK> the malware logs in to an internet relay chat channel or other chat system the attacker can then give instructions to all the infected systems simultaneously <UNK> can also be used to push upgraded malware to the infected systems keeping them resistant to anti virus software or other security measures lastly it is possible for a malware creator to profit by simply stealing from the person whose computer is infected stealing here can mean stealing information such as passwords or outright financial theft some malware programs install a key <UNK> which copies down the user s <UNK> when entering a password credit card number or other useful information this is then transmitted to the malware creator automatically enabling credit card fraud and other theft similarly malware may copy the cd key or password for online games allowing the creator to steal accounts or virtual items another way of stealing money from the infected pc owner is to take control of the modem and dial an expensive toll call <UNK> or porn <UNK> software dials up a premium rate telephone number such as a u s nine zero zero number and leaves the line open costing the user hundreds of dollars in telephone bills malware tools and aids exploit an exploit is a piece of software that attacks a particular security vulnerability exploits are not necessarily malicious in intent they are often devised by security researchers as a way of demonstrating that a vulnerability exists however they are a common component of malicious programs such as network worms curing an infection unfortunately cleaning an operating system that has been infected by malware is no longer as simple as it used to be malware has become increasingly more difficult to clean as malware creators find more ways to avoid removal no single anti virus or anti spyware application can reliably successfully remove all malware that has been installed on a computer in fact it is not unusual to resort to an arsenal of security products online scanners and anti spyware virus software in an attempt to ensure everything has been properly removed furthermore there are many dubious anti malware products from those that are advertised by malware or those from creators who strike deals with malware creators to ignore their software to

sri lankan cricketer a hugely successful off spin bowler he is generally recognised as the greatest sri lankan player and the greatest off spinner in cricket history since his international debut in one nine nine two he has enjoyed more success than any other spinner except shane <UNK> and has become one of the most acclaimed cricketers of the modern age however in recent years he has been dogged by controversy over the legality of his unorthodox bowling action statistically there is no doubt that he is one of the most effective bowlers ever to play cricket in both international forms of the game test and one day internationals currently his test record stands at almost six zero zero wickets at an average of just two two five this compares favourably to other contemporary spin bowlers shane <UNK> s bowling average is two five two <UNK> <UNK> s two eight eight and fellow off spinner <UNK> singh s two nine five in two zero zero two <UNK> named him the greatest bowler of all time in may two zero zero four in zimbabwe he overtook west indian courtney walsh s record of five one nine test match wickets to become the highest wicket taker of all time <UNK> an australian leg spinner is his only current rival for that record indeed he overtook <UNK> s number of wickets in late two zero zero four <UNK> believes that the younger <UNK> will eventually be the one to finish with the record saying he believes that <UNK> will take one zero zero zero wickets in truth an unlikely achievement before he retires <UNK> s unorthodox bowling action begins with a unique flapping wings run up complete with <UNK> eyes and culminates with an extremely <UNK> delivery which he claims often had him mistaken for a leg spinner early in his career he generates a prodigious amount of turn in addition to the <UNK> of the ball that is very hard for a batsman to play at aside from his off break he also a bowls a fast <UNK> which goes straight on and his own interpretation of <UNK> <UNK> s controversial <UNK> delivery which turns from leg to off <UNK> became politically active in two zero zero four becoming an ambassador for the united nations world food program and joining an anti poverty campaign he said he was lucky to be alive after narrowly missing the two zero zero four indian ocean earthquake by just two zero minutes one week later he was reported to be helping distribute food to victims of the tsunami he is one of two tamils in the sri lankan cricket team the other being russel arnold there has long been ethnic tension in sri lanka between the minority tamil and the majority sinhalese communities and some members of the tamil community feel that <UNK> should not play for the sri lankan national team <UNK> married an indian woman <UNK> <UNK> in two zero zero five world records and achievements <UNK> <UNK> holds a number of world records and several firsts the highest number of international wickets tests and <UNK> ever by an off <UNK> held the world record for the highest wickets in test matches for a brief period he is the only bowler to cross one zero zero zero wickets both forms of the game put together most number of one zero wicket <UNK> in a match at test level he also holds the dubious record of <UNK> the maximum number of runs in an odi match without taking a single wicket which also happens to be the most number of runs given away in the five zero over version of the game his figures were zero nine nine controversy of bowling action poster of the united peoples freedom alliance supporting <UNK> on the bowling issue <UNK> s bowling action is controversial amongst many purists as to some it appears that it <UNK> the laws of the game by <UNK> the arm in the course of the delivery this is despite his action being exonerated unanimously by an international panel consisting of members from every test playing nation the controversy came to a head after australian umpire darrell hair called a no ball for an illegal action seven times during the boxing day test match in melbourne australia in one nine nine five after discussions between the australian cricket board and the board of control for cricket in sri lanka hair <UNK> no further games involving sri lanka in the season reaction to hair s actions was mixed he was widely criticised in sri lanka and elsewhere but some particularly in australia felt that it was long <UNK> it would be simplistic to assume that opinion was divided purely by nationality though with australia s greatest ever cricketer sir donald bradman quoted as saying it was the worst example of <UNK> that he had witnessed and against everything the game stands for clearly <UNK> does not throw the ball <UNK> was later no <UNK> for throwing by australian umpires ross emerson and tony <UNK> in a one day international against the west indies in brisbane australia in the same summer following this season <UNK> underwent <UNK> tests in hong kong and australia under the supervision of bowling experts who cleared his action as legal citing a congenital defect in <UNK> s arm which makes him incapable of <UNK> it but giving the appearance of the arm <UNK> in the bowling action doubts about <UNK> s action persisted particularly in australia in one nine nine nine he was once again called for throwing by umpire ross emerson in an odi against england at the adelaide oval in australia the sri lankan team almost abandoned the match but after instructions from the president of the <UNK> relayed to captain arjuna <UNK> by mobile phone the game resumed <UNK> took his five zero zero th test wicket in the second test against australia in <UNK> on march one six two zero zero four at the end of the series his <UNK> delivery was officially called into question by match referee chris broad and <UNK> was entered into a two stage <UNK> process for bowlers with suspect actions under the supervision of the international cricket council icc the delivery was examined by <UNK> experts who found it to exceed the current tolerance limit regarding the degree of bend in the arm of five degrees for slow bowlers australian prime minister john howard weighed in controversially labelling <UNK> a <UNK> despite this he won accolades from former australian captain steve waugh who said he was the don bradman of bowling waugh went on to say that he felt <UNK> s action was perfectly legal bowling action of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> has subsequently been videotaped bowling while wearing an arm brace that prevents the <UNK> of the arm in an attempt to clear his name once and for all it appears unlikely that this will ever happen as his critics maintain that only his bowling during real matches can be considered and that it s possible he changes his action when under scrutiny some experts who have viewed such tests have dismissed their value former indian spinner <UNK> bedi has been particularly vocal in his criticism of the testing asking why should a bowler be allowed to chuck because he has a defective arm and comparing <UNK> s action with that of javelin thrower there is speculation that the match referee s actions were an attempt to derail <UNK> s attempt to become the all time leading wicket taker former players like arjuna <UNK> believe this to be a white conspiracy with some australians and englishmen wishing to get the name <UNK> expunged from cricket records <UNK> asserted that <UNK> was being picked on because of his skin colour <UNK> s actions were seen by some as an attempt to deflect inquiries over <UNK> s action by branding those making such claims with the pejorative term racist it should be noted that <UNK> has many powerful allies in australia and england examples include mark nicholas bruce <UNK> and steve waugh all of whom have supported <UNK> publicly it is claimed that sir donald bradman also spoke very highly of <UNK> an extensive icc study the results of which were released in november two zero zero four was conducted to investigate the <UNK> issue a panel of former test players with the assistance of several <UNK> experts revealed that nine nine of all bowlers bent their arms when bowling only one player in the world batsman <UNK> <UNK> did not <UNK> the rules when tested <UNK> s off break and <UNK> were deemed within the rules two to five degree <UNK> but the <UNK> was still an area of concern the <UNK> measured when bowling the <UNK> was not excessive however considering the amount of <UNK> in the actions of many other bowlers the panel has recommended that the current law be expanded to extend the tolerance limit on the degree of bending to one five degrees for all bowlers if these findings are implemented then <UNK> s <UNK> would be deemed legal this scientific evidence has gone a long way to convincing many of <UNK> s former critics that his action is legal two vocal critics of <UNK> s action were former test cricketers west indian michael holding a member of the icc s advisory panel on illegal deliveries and australian dean jones holding had been quoted as being in one one zero agreement with bedi regarding <UNK> s action and jones had said by my interpretation i think he throws it following the icc study and the

speed heavy metal band the name was derived from a slang term for an amphetamine user founded by ex hawkwind bassist lemmy kilmister in one nine seven five the band specialises in songs that are extremely loud to the <UNK> listener this is reflected in the title of one of the band s live albums everything louder than everyone else while the band are typically classified as heavy metal or speed metal kilmister has refused such labels preferring to describe mot rhead s style as rock and roll their sound tends to be half metal half punk and half rock n roll purposely three halves of a band mot rhead s lyrics cover such topics as war good versus evil abuse of power promiscuous sex substance abuse and life on the road the latter is portrayed in songs like we are the road crew iron horse and keep us on the road history after being sacked from hawkwind in one nine seven five supposedly for doing the wrong drugs kilmister decided to form a new band originally to be called bastard realising that this would preclude them from commercial acceptance he eventually settled on mot rhead after a song he had written for hawkwind his stated aim was for the outfit to be the <UNK> rock n

identical copy of you about one zero meters away level ii andre linde s bubble theory in chaotic inflation other <UNK> regions may have different effective physical constants dimensionality and particle content surprisingly this level includes wheeler s oscillating universe theory as well level iii hugh everett iii s many worlds interpretation an interpretation of quantum mechanics that proposes the existence of multiple universes all of which are identical but exist in possibly different states it is widely believed that everett s interpretation considered as a formal theory is a conservative extension of standard quantum mechanics that is as far as results <UNK> in the language of ordinary quantum mechanics is concerned it leads to no new results this according to <UNK> is ironic given that this level has historically been the most controversial level iv the ultimate ensemble theory of <UNK> other mathematical structures give different fundamental equations of physics this level considers real any hypothetical universe based on one of these structures m theory might be placed here since this <UNK> all other possible ensembles it brings closure to the hierarchy of <UNK> there cannot be a level v open multiverse alexander <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> and others have recently argued that there are an infinite number of regions of space the same size as our observable universe that is that one can travel forever in any direction and always continue to reach new points this assumption relies on the theory that at some stage in the past matter was distributed fairly evenly across space and later condensed to form objects dense enough to become the source for a big bang however in this situation we would expect that rather than there being only a single big bang matter would condense in a number of places separated by astronomical distances forming a network or lattice of big bangs all exploding and then contracting like a network of flashing lights or the atoms in a crystal thus rather than having a single big bang and a single universe there would be a collection of universes or a multiverse bubble theory the formation of our universe from a bubble of a multiverse was proposed by andre linde this bubble universe theory fits well with the widely accepted theory of inflation the bubble universe concept involves creation of universes from the quantum foam of a parent universe on very small scales the foam is <UNK> due to energy fluctuations these fluctuations may create tiny bubbles and wormholes if the energy fluctuation is not very large a tiny bubble universe may form experience some expansion like an inflating balloon and then contract and disappear from existence however if the energy fluctuation is greater than a particular critical value a tiny bubble universe forms from the parent universe experiences long term expansion and allows matter and large scale galactic structures to form big bounce according to some quantum loop gravity theorists the big bang was merely the beginning of a period of expansion that followed a period of contraction in this <UNK> universe hypothesis originally attributable to john wheeler the universe undergoes an infinite series of oscillations each beginning with a big bang and ending with a big crunch after the big bang the universe expands for a while before the gravitational attraction of matter causes it to collapse back in and undergo a big bounce although the model was abandoned for a time the theory has been revived in brane cosmology as the cyclic model many world interpretation of quantum physics hugh everett s many worlds interpretation <UNK> is one of several mainstream interpretations of quantum mechanics other interpretations include the copenhagen and the consistent histories interpretations the multiverse proposed by <UNK> has a shared time parameter in most formulations all the constituent universes are structurally identical to each other and though they have the same physical laws and values for the fundamental constants they may exist in different states the constituent universes are furthermore non communicating in the sense that no information can pass between them the state of the entire multiverse is related to the states of the constituent universes by quantum superposition related are richard feynman s multiple histories interpretation and h dieter <UNK> s many minds interpretation m theory a multiverse of a somewhat different kind has been envisaged within the one one dimensional extension of string theory known as m theory in m theory our universe and others are created by collisions between membranes in an one one dimensional space unlike the universes in the quantum multiverse these universes can have completely different laws of physics anything may be possible string landscape another proposal for a multiverse in string theory this type iib string theory has received considerable attention lately it is called the string landscape and asserts that roughly speaking there are a very large number of ways to go from ten dimensional string theory down to the four dimensional low energy world we see and each one of these corresponds to a radically different universe arguments against multiverse theories it s not science critics claim that there is a lack of empirical correlation and <UNK> in these theories and thus they are without hard physical evidence and must therefore be considered unfalsifiable currently outside the methodology of scientific investigation to confirm or disprove and therefore more mathematically theoretical and metaphysical than scientific in nature but <UNK> points out improved measurements of the microwave background radiation and of the large scale distribution of matter may <UNK> or knock down two pillars of the multiverse the <UNK> of space and the theory of chaotic inflation it s bad science some have argued that the job of the scientist is to provide fundamental explanations for observed phenomena without making reference to observers resorting to anthropic principles constitutes a lazy way out of accounting for features such as the apparent fine tuning of parameters in relation to the existence of life leonard <UNK> claims however that some form of multiverse is unavoidable given the current state of physics and that observer effects are inevitable and have to be taken into account in other sciences alternate universes violate occam s razor to postulate an infinity of unseen and <UNK> universes just to explain the one we do see seems like a case of excess baggage carried to the extreme <UNK> answers a common feature of all four multiverse levels is that the simplest and arguably most elegant theory involves parallel universes by default to deny the existence of those universes one needs to complicate the theory by adding experimentally unsupported processes and ad hoc postulates finite space wave function collapse and ontological asymmetry our judgment therefore comes down to which we find more wasteful and <UNK> many worlds or many words thus paradoxically the multiverse scenario is more <UNK> than that of a single universe there is only one possible universe it is occasionally argued that the observed universe is the unique possible universe so that talk of other universes is <UNK> facto meaningless einstein raised this possibility when he wondered whether the universe could have been otherwise or non existent altogether the hope is sometimes expressed that once a fully unified theory of physics is achieved it will turn out to have a unique solution corresponding to the observed universe measures of fine tuning are meaningless the principal observational support for the multiverse hypothesis comes from the anthropic principle the universe we observe is bio friendly or we would not be observing it while this is a tautology when the sensitivity of biology to the form of the laws of physics and the cosmological initial conditions is considered it has some apparent credence but on the other hand many key parameters of physics do not seem to be very strongly constrained by biology another criticism of the fine tuning argument is that as far as we know there could be a more fundamental law under which the parameters of physics must have the values they do thus given such a law it is not improbable that the known parameters of physics fall within the life permitting range <UNK> merely shift the problem up one level multiverse proponents are often vague about how the parameter values are selected across the defined ensemble if there is a law of laws or meta law describing how parameter values are assigned from one universe to the next then we have only shifted the central problems of cosmology up one level because we need to explain where the meta law comes from moreover the set of such meta laws is infinite so we have merely replaced the question why this universe with why this meta law there would seem to be little point in invoking an infinity of universes when it would be simpler to postulate a single universe with a single principle in <UNK> s extreme multiverse theory this problem is circumvented because in that case all possible meta laws or all possible unified theories are in force and describe really existing <UNK> the fake universe problem most scientists are prepared to entertain the possibility of conscious machines and some artificial intelligence advocates even claim we are not far from producing conscious computers it is then but a small step to the point where the engineered conscious beings inhabit a simulated world for such beings their fake universe will appear indistinguishable from reality so should we include these simulated universes in the ensemble that constitutes the multiverse is it meaningful to assign equal ontological status to our own observed universe and universes that are virtual if it is not then is it meaningful to assign equal ontological status to our own observed universe and universes that can never be observed by any sentient being why stop there the last objection to the existing multiverse theories is a challenge to the criteria for defining universes in most multiverse theories universes are labeled by laws of physics and initial conditions it might be objected that these terms are narrow and <UNK> there may be criteria for categorization that lie completely beyond the scope of human comprehension multiverse hypotheses in philosophy anthropic principle the concept of other universes has been proposed to explain why our universe seems to be fine tuned for conscious life as we experience it if there were a large number possibly infinite of different physical laws or fundamental constants in as many universes some of these would have laws that were suitable for stars planets and life to exist the anthropic principle could then be applied to conclude that we would only consciously exist in those universes which were finely tuned for our conscious existence thus while the probability might be extremely small that there is life in most of the <UNK> this scarcity of life supporting universes does not imply design is the only explanation of our existence the entire range of multiverse hypotheses with specific emphasis on hugh everett s many worlds interpretation have been criticised by proponents of intelligent design william dembski in particular <UNK> it as inflating explanatory resources without evidence or warrant and terms such concepts <UNK> recent pronouncements by church authorities suggest the catholic church now appears to reject all such hypotheses as well in what may be a reversal of a long standing hands off policy regarding the physical sciences see and for an alternate view now at the beginning of the two one st century faced with scientific claims like neo darwinism and the multiverse hypothesis in cosmology invented to avoid the overwhelming evidence for purpose and design found in modern science the catholic church will again defend human reason by proclaiming that the immanent design evident in nature is real christoph sch <UNK> modal realism additionally possible worlds are a way of explaining probability hypothetical statements and the like and some philosophers such as david lewis believe that all possible worlds actually exist a position known as modal realism this thesis is one of the central tenets of his book lewis one nine eight six trans world identity issues a metaphysical issue that crops up with multiverse schema that posit infinite identical copies of any given universe is that of the notion that there can be identical objects in different possible worlds the problem lies in the tension between classical notions of identity and quantum <UNK> in short quantum reality does not allow classical radically mechanical identities due to the heisenberg uncertainty principle however in an infinite set of possible universes such a correspondence is presumed to exist the question then becomes whether one can claim a distinction between entities that vary only in terms of some arbitrary dimensional metric in de sitter space suggested resolutions include the possibilities that synchronous <UNK> parallel universe <UNK> are invalid synchronous <UNK> parallel universes belong to a part whole relationship quantum fluctuations average out within the heisenberg limit between duplicates alternate criteria are needed to <UNK> assess the concept of identity trans world

pakistan history of the middle east middle east wars by region molotov cocktail also known as a petrol bomb <UNK> torch molotov grenade or a molotov bomb is the generic name for a variety of crude incendiary weapons commonly associated with irregular military forces and rioters they are more frequently used for basic arson in urban slang they are often referred to as a homemade <UNK> how it works a molotov cocktail consists of a glass bottle partly filled with flammable liquid usually gasoline or alcohol methanol or ethanol the mouth of the bottle is stopped up with a cork or other type of airtight bung rubber glass or plastic and a cloth rag is fixed securely around the mouth the weapon is used by first soaking the rag in a flammable liquid immediately prior to using it lighting the rag and throwing the bottle at the target the bottle <UNK> on impact spilling the flammable liquid over the target which is then ignited by the burning rag common practice is to throw several full <UNK> bottles to <UNK> an area then to ignite the target with a lit one this avoids some of the risk of throwing several lit devices such as revealing the attacker s location missing the target or dropping the molotov cocktail many substances may be added to the basic molotov cocktail to enhance its use as a weapon self inflammatory materials such as white phosphorus may be used to guarantee the bottle s explosion as it hits the target surface tar palm oil laundry <UNK> liquid dish soap dissolved <UNK> sugar or other thickening agents are often added to make the burning fluid stick to the target tar also helps to make a thick black smoke in their wars with the soviet union finnish soldiers often used hand soap <UNK> and tar for this purpose acid may be added to increase both the damage from the explosive device and its ability to penetrate fire resistant surfaces <UNK> can also be added to mixture inside the bottle to increase burn time and burn through many surfaces as a result of the molten iron created in the <UNK> reaction molotov cocktails are similar to napalm bombs in principle napalm short for na <UNK> palm <UNK> acids was originally made by combining flammable <UNK> and petrol with a thickening agent <UNK> acid the latter two being the main ingredients of molotov cocktails according to che guevara s writings the ideal mixture for creating an anti personnel sheet of flame is three parts gasoline to one part motor oil this type of molotov may also be launched from a modified one six gauge shotgun history a mural in derry of a young boy in a gas mask holding a petrol bomb during the battle of the <UNK> august one nine six nine the name molotov cocktail is derived from vyacheslav <UNK> molotov a soviet politician who was the people s commissar for foreign affairs foreign minister of the soviet union with an ironic reference to the one nine three zero s fashion for pre dinner cocktails during the buildup to world war ii when finland refused to surrender some land to the soviet union the soviets invaded the poorly equipped and heavily outnumbered finnish army facing red army tanks in what came to be known as the winter war borrowed an improvised incendiary device from the one nine three six three nine spanish civil war in that conflict the church and axis backed nationalists under general francisco franco had used the weapon against soviet t two six tanks supporting the spanish republicans in a failed one nine three six soviet assault near toledo three zero km from madrid when molotov claimed in radio broadcasts that the soviet union was not dropping bombs but rather delivering food to the starving finns the finns started to call the air bombs <UNK> molotov picnic baskets soon they responded by <UNK> the advancing tanks with molotov cocktails at first the term was used to describe only the burning mixture itself but in practical use the term was soon applied to the combination of both the bottle and its contents this finnish use of the hand or sling thrown explosive against soviet tanks was repeated in the subsequent continuation war molotov cocktails were eventually mass produced by the finnish military bundled with matches to light them these weapons saw widespread use by all sides in world war ii they were very effective against light tanks and very bad for enemy morale the following is a first hand description of their effects written during the warsaw ghetto uprising in one nine four three the well aimed bottles hit the tank the flames spread quickly the blast of the explosion is heard the machine stands motionless the crew is burned alive the other two tanks turn around and withdraw the germans who took cover behind them withdraw in panic we take leave of them with a few well aimed shots and grenades during the one nine four eight arab israeli war members of the israeli <UNK> <UNK> managed to stop a syrian tank assault by using molotov cocktails they were frequently used against soviet tanks with great efficiency in the hungarian revolution of one nine five six molotov cocktails are much more effective against gasoline engines than diesel engines diesel is very viscous and has a high <UNK> of six four c making it much less flammable and <UNK> compared to petrol the weapon has been used against tanks effectively because of the conformation of parts of tanks particularly around the <UNK> and fuel tank entrances a molotov cocktail will often blow up the gasoline tank destroying the machine particularly for older tank models some soviet tanks actually had an entry to the gas tank on the side of the vehicle which could be opened by combatants in close quarters letting out the highly flammable liquid and making destruction of the tank even easier note that these tactics were only effective due to the advantage guerrillas had in close quarters tanks can barely maneuver in such conditions and are not able to counter quick moving enemies armed with incendiary bombs petrol bombs were widely used throughout the troubles in northern ireland in riot situations directed towards the <UNK> or the british army as well as occasional situations where they continue to be used against the <UNK> and army they are frequently used in sectarian attacks on homes and businesses by both communities fireworks and homemade grenades blast bombs now commonly accompany petrol bomb attacks on the security forces handling the easy construction of a molotov cocktail makes it a standard weapon of guerrilla warfare and violent rioters but it can be challenging for an amateur to make an effective device the most common failure is in over filling the bottle as a full bottle will not ignite quickly when it breaks on impact although it has a longer burning potential for a device to explode rapidly on impact the bottle should be only one half to two thirds full however one must consider whether the additional power is worth the risk of a premature explosion another common mistake is failing to wipe down the bottle which removes flammable residue prior to lighting the rag yet another error is to use the ignition rag directly to <UNK> the bottle other common difficulties include failing to make an airtight seal with the <UNK> to prevent escaping fumes a too long or too loosely secured ignition rag using an inappropriate bottle e g short necked wide <UNK> too fragile or too tough and above all mishandling after the rag is ignited a common modification is to use a sealed bottle of flammable liquid still no more than two thirds full for example a liquor bottle with a screw on lid and tightly rubber band a <UNK> without <UNK> soaked in flammable liquid to the neck the feminine product holds a large quantity of liquid does not degrade due to the <UNK> of the petrol and its lightweight aerodynamic shape causes less drag than would a rag using a sealed bottle prevents the thrower from <UNK> himself and those near him in flaming liquid when winding up to throw in order to easily transport the device the <UNK> can be wrapped in <UNK> after being soaked in gasoline a cigarette lighter can easily burn through the <UNK> and ignite the <UNK> at the moment of use it is thus possible for a woman carrying a bottle of liquor <UNK> a <UNK> cigarettes and lighter to be in the possession of deadly ingredients that would ordinarily arouse little suspicion in short molotov cocktails are inherently dangerous devices due to their incendiary or explosive nature the manufacture and use of molotov cocktails involves serious danger to the unskilled manufacturer legality as incendiary devices molotov cocktails are illegal to manufacture or possess in many regions their use against people is typically covered under a variety of charges including assault actual or grievous bodily harm manslaughter attempted murder and murder depending upon their effect and upon local laws their use against property is usually covered under arson charges in the united states molotov cocktails are considered destructive devices and regulated by the <UNK> recent use molotov cocktails were put to use recently during the <UNK> two zero zero five civil unrest in france another situation with popularity for them is the palestinian intifada in sydney during the <UNK> riots rioters carrying molotov cocktails were apprehended when they carried open bottles in a bus the

from training data the training data consist of pairs of input objects typically vectors and desired outputs the output of the function can be a continuous value called regression or can predict a class label of the input object called classification the task of the supervised learner is to predict the value of the function for any valid input object after having seen a number of training examples i e pairs of input and target output to achieve this the learner has to generalize from the presented data to unseen situations in a reasonable way see inductive bias compare with <UNK> learning supervised learning can generate models of two types most commonly supervised learning generates a global model that maps input objects to desired outputs in some cases however the map is implemented as a set of local models such as in case based reasoning or the nearest neighbor algorithm in order to solve a given problem of supervised learning e g learning to recognize handwriting one has to consider various steps determine the type of training examples before doing anything else the engineer should decide what kind of data is to be used as an example for instance this might be a single handwritten character an entire handwritten word or an entire line of handwriting gathering a training set the training set needs to be characteristic of the real world use of the function thus a set of input objects is gathered and corresponding outputs are also gathered either from human experts or from measurements determine the input feature representation of the learned function the accuracy of the learned function depends strongly on how the input object is represented typically the input object is transformed into a feature vector which contains a number of features that are descriptive of the object the number of features should not be too large because of the curse of dimensionality but should be large enough to accurately predict the output determine the structure of the learned function and corresponding learning algorithm for example the engineer may choose to use artificial neural networks or decision trees complete the design the engineer then runs the learning algorithm on the gathered training set parameters of the learning algorithm may be adjusted by optimizing performance on a subset called a validation set of the training set or via cross validation after parameter adjustment and learning the performance of the algorithm may be measured on a test set that is separate from the training set empirical risk <UNK> the goal of supervised learning of a global model is to find a function g given a set of points of the form x g x it is assumed that the set of points for which the behavior of g is known is an i i d sample drawn according to an unknown probability distribution p of a larger possibly infinite population furthermore one assumes the existence of a task specific loss function l of type l y times y to bbb where y is the codomain of g and l maps into the <UNK> real numbers further restrictions may be placed on l the quantity l z y is the loss incurred by predicting z as the value of g at a given point when the true

microsoft access is a relational database management system from microsoft packaged with microsoft office professional which combines the relational microsoft jet database engine with a graphical user interface it can use data stored in access jet sql server oracle or any <UNK> compliant data container skilled software developers and data architects use it to develop powerful complex application software relatively unskilled programmers and non programmer power users can use it to build simple applications without having to deal with features they don t understand it supports substantial object oriented oo techniques but falls short of being a fully oo development tool microsoft access was also the name of a communications program from microsoft meant to compete with <UNK> and other programs it proved a failure and was dropped years later they reused the name for their database software uses access is widely used by small businesses and hobby programmers to create ad hoc customized systems for handling small tasks its ease of use and powerful design tools give the non professional programmer a lot of power for little effort however this ease of use can be misleading this sort of developer is often an office worker with little or no training in application or data design because access makes it possible even for such developers to create usable systems many are misled into thinking that the tool itself is limited to such applications some professional application developers use access for rapid application development especially for the creation of prototypes and standalone applications that serve as tools for on the road <UNK> access does not scale well if data access is via a network so applications that are used by more than a handful of people tend to rely on a client server based solution such as oracle db two microsoft sql server <UNK> mysql or <UNK> however an access front end the forms reports queries and <UNK> code can be used against a host of database <UNK> including access itself sql server oracle and any other <UNK> compliant product this approach allows the developer to move a matured application s data to a more powerful server without sacrificing the development already in place many developers who use microsoft access use the <UNK> naming convention though this is not universal it is a programming convention not a dbms enforced rule features one of the benefits of access from a programmer s perspective is its relative compatibility with sql queries may be viewed and edited as sql statements and sql statements can be used directly in macros and vba modules to manipulate access tables users may mix and use both vba and macros for programming forms and logic and offers object oriented

lack of knowledge about this fact has contributed to an <UNK> disrespect for access jet family of software products particularly as regards large projects access cut and paste functionality can make it a useful tool for connecting between other databases for example oracle and microsoft sql server during data or database conversions access comes with various import and export features that allow integration with windows and other platform applications several of which can be executed on demand from within applications or manually by the user for example the very compact <UNK> format for sharing perfectly formatted reports with people who don t have the full access software it can also easily be upgraded to microsoft sql server unlike complete <UNK> it lacks database triggers and stored procedures it does allow forms to contain code that is triggered as changes are made to the underlying table and it is common to use pass through queries and other techniques in access to run stored procedures in <UNK> that support these development the programming language available in access is as in other products of the microsoft office suite microsoft visual basic for applications two database access libraries of com components are provided the legacy data access objects dao only available with access and the new activex data objects ado microsoft access is easily applied to small projects but scales <UNK> to large projects if applications are designed poorly all database queries forms and reports are stored in the database and in keeping with the ideals of the relational model there is no possibility of making a physically structured hierarchy with them one design technique is to divide an access application between data and programs one database should contain only tables and relationships while another would have all programs forms reports and queries and links to the first database tables unfortunately access allows no relative paths when linking so the development environment should have the same path as the production environment although you can write your own dynamic linker routine in vba that can search out a certain back end file by searching through the directory tree if it can t find it in the current path this technique also allows the developer to divide the application among different files so some structure is possible further reading database

enzymes resulting in either the formation of a metabolic product to be used or stored by the cell or the initiation of another metabolic pathway then called a flux generating step many of these pathways are elaborate and involve a step by step modification of the initial substance to shape it into the product with the exact chemical structure desired overview metabolic pathways often have these common properties they are reversible usually because the first step is a committed step such as breakdown for the release of energy that runs in two directions the pathways are regulated

subsistence level conditions as a result of agricultural or in later formulations economic production being eventually outstripped by growth in population theories of <UNK> catastrophe are very similar to the subsistence theory of wages the main difference is that the <UNK> theories predict over several generations or centuries whereas the subsistence theory of wages predicts over years and decades traditional views in one seven nine eight thomas malthus published his now famous an essay on the principle of population describing his theory of quantitative development of human populations i think i may fairly make two <UNK> first that food is necessary to the existence of man secondly that the passion between the sexes is necessary and will remain nearly in its present state these two laws ever since we have had any knowledge of mankind appear to have been fixed laws of our nature and as we have not hitherto seen any alteration in them we have no right to conclude that they will ever cease to be what they now are without an immediate act of power in that being who first arranged the system of the universe and for the advantage of his creatures still executes according to fixed laws all its various operations assuming then my <UNK> as granted i say that the power of population is indefinitely greater than the power in the earth to produce subsistence for man population when unchecked increases in a geometrical ratio malthus one seven nine eight chapter one online series increasing in geometric progression are defined by the fact that the quotient of any two successive members of the sequence is a constant e g a populations has a average birth rate of say one two or in the <UNK> world of the one eight th century maybe rather two three babies per population member in five zero years so the entire unchecked population will grow in a ratio of one two or two three per five zero years malthus assumed the grow of agrarian economics as linear the arithmetic ratio is defined so that any two successive members of the sequence have a constant difference if unchecked progressive growth can easily outrun linear growth even if the quotient between successive sequence members is only slightly larger than one zero so malthus concluded that the population will be naturally checked by misery vice or the like in natural development every phase of unchecked exponential progression possible e g when inhabiting new habitats or colonies e g on the american continent at malthus time or when recovering from wars and epidemic plagues will be followed by a catastrophe or misery and thus unlimited growth may even directly cause misery and vice malthus one seven nine eight chapter seven a probable cause of epidemics online neo <UNK> theory neo <UNK> theory argues that unless at or below subsistence level a population s fertility will tend to move upwards assume for example that a country has one zero breeding groups over time this country s fertility will approach that of its fastest growing group in the same way that f t a times one zero one t b times one zero two t mbox b ne zero will eventually come to resemble g t b times one zero two t regardless of how large the constant a is or how small the constant b is under subsistence conditions the fastest growing group is likely to be that group progressing most rapidly in agricultural technology however in above subsistence conditions the fastest growing group is likely to be the one with the highest fertility therefore the fertility of the country will approach that of its most fertile group this however is only part of the problem in any group some individuals will be more pro fertility in their beliefs and practices than others according to neo <UNK> theory these pro fertility individuals will not only have more children but also pass their pro fertility on to their children meaning a constant selection for pro fertility similar to the constant evolutionary selection for fertility genes except much faster because of greater diversity according to neo <UNK> this increase in fertility will lead to <UNK> population growth that will eventually <UNK> growth in economic production this appears to make any sort of voluntary fertility control futile in the long run neo <UNK> argue that although adult immigrants who at the very least arrive with human capital contribute to economic production there is little or no increase in economic production from increased natural growth and fertility neo <UNK> argue that <UNK> population growth has begun or will begin soon in developed countries to this can be added that unknown to malthus farmland <UNK> with use some areas where there was intensive agriculture in classic times had already declined in population because their farmland was worn out long before he wrote non occurrence of the catastrophe at the time malthus wrote most societies had populations at or near their agricultural limits but by the late two zero th century the new agricultural technologies of the green revolution had greatly expanded agricultural production throughout the world exponential not arithmetic growth rate as malthus believe for food production and that what he termed misery war political unrest and other forms of population control would lower population far before the famine he believed would occur of malthus s misery and vice the most powerful factors were population control that many do not deem to be miserable or sinful despite thomas malthus s opinions most technologically developed countries had by this time passed through the demographic transition a complex social development in which total fertility rates drop drastically in response to lower infant mortality more education of women increased urbanization and a wider availability of effective birth control by the end of the two zero th century these countries could avoid population declines only by permitting large scale immigration on the assumption that the demographic transition would spread to less developed countries the united nations population fund estimated that human population would peak in the late two one st century rather than continue to grow until it exhausted available resources another problem is that there is no strong evidence that the human population nor any real population actually follows exponential growth in plant or animal populations that are claimed to show exponential growth closer examination invariably shows that the supposedly exponential curve is actually the lower limb of a logistic curve or a section of a <UNK> <UNK> cycle also examination of records of estimated total world human population shows at best very weak evidence of exponential growth a chart of estimated world population one eight zero zero two zero five zero only the section in blue is made up of reliable counts and not estimates the annual increase graph does not appear as one would expect for exponential growth for exponential growth it should itself be an upward <UNK> exponential curve whereas it has actually been <UNK> downward since one nine eight six also the rate of increase should increase whereas of the increase between the early one nine five zero s and today five sixths occurred in the one nine five zero s and the first half of the one nine six zero s presumably attributable to the green revolution it then rose to a peak in one nine eight nine and has since declined to levels approaching those of one nine seven zero a chart of changes in world population one nine five two two zero zero two though short term trends even on the scale of decades or centuries do not necessarily disprove the underlying mechanisms promoting a <UNK> catastrophe over longer periods the relative prosperity of the human population at the beginning of the two one st century and the apparent failure of spectacular predictions of mass starvation or ecological collapse made by activists such as paul r ehrlich in the one nine six zero s and one nine seven zero s has led many people such as economist julian l simon to question its inevitability application to energy resource <UNK> another way of applying the <UNK> theory is to substitute other resources such as sources of energy for food and resource energy consumption for population since modern food production is energy and resource intensive this is not a big jump most of the criteria for applying the theory are still satisfied since resources energy consumption is increasing much faster than population and most of our resources energy comes from polluting and non renewable sources the catastrophe appears more imminent though perhaps not as certain than when considering food and population continue to behave in a manner contradicting malthus s assumptions retired physics professor albert bartlett a modern day <UNK> has lectured on arithmetic population and energy over one five zero zero times he published an article entitled thoughts on long term energy supplies scientists and the silent lie in physics today july two zero zero four for a response to bartlett s argument see two articles on energy and

protestant reformation in particular new emphasis was placed on the passages in the book of revelation which seemed to say that satan would be locked away for one zero zero zero years but then released on the world in a final battle rev two zero one six previous catholic and orthodox theologians had no clear or consensus view on what this actually meant only the concept of an end of the world coming unexpected like a thief in a night and the concept of the antichrist were almost universally held <UNK> theories try to explain what this one zero zero zero years of satan in chains would be like various types of <UNK> exist with regard to christian eschatology especially within protestantism such as premillennialism <UNK> and <UNK> the first two refer to different views of the relationship between the millennial kingdom and christ s second coming premillennialism sees christ s second advent as preceding the millennium thereby separating the second coming from the final judgment in this view christ s reign will be physical <UNK> see s christ s second coming as subsequent to the millennium and consequent with the final judgment in this view christ s reign during the millennium will be spiritual in and through the church <UNK> basically denies a future literal one zero zero zero year kingdom and sees the church age metaphorically described in rev two zero one six in this view christ s reign is current in and through the church pre christian <UNK> although never officially recognized by the catholic church and actually pronounced a heresy as early as four three one ad <UNK> which had clearly already existed in jewish thought received a new interpretation and fresh impetus with the arrival of christianity a millennium is a period of one thousand years and in particular christ s thousand year rule on this earth either directly preceding or immediately following the second coming and the day of judgement the millennium reverses the previous period of evil and suffering it rewards the virtuous for their courage while punishing the evil <UNK> with a clear separation of saints and sinners the vision of a thousand year period of bliss for the faithful to be enjoyed here on earth heaven on earth exerted an irresistible power although the picture of life in the millennial era is almost willfully obscure and hardly more appealing than that of say the golden age what has made the millennium much more powerful than the golden age or paradise myths are the activities of the sects and movements that it has inspired throughout the ages hundreds of sects were convinced that the millennium was imminent about to begin in the very near future with precise dates given on many occasions <UNK> sects look for signs of christ s imminent return other <UNK> sects such as the prophetic anabaptist followers of thomas m <UNK> have believed that the millennium had already begun with only their own members having realized this fact consequently they have attempted to live out their own vision of millennial life radically overturning the beliefs and practices of the surrounding society in doing so they offered a model of the good life and expressed their hope that soon the rest of the world would follow and live like they did see christian eschatology for a discussion of premillennialism and <UNK> transition to the millennium millennial sects have typically believed that the transition from the present age to the millennium would be anything but smooth with the antichrist having to be defeated and jesus reign on earth having to be established millennial theories differ as to whether the battle with the antichrist will occur before or after the one zero zero zero years leaders of some movements have seen it as their responsibility to bring about the expected disastrous wars which would bring an end to the present age based on revelation two zero three some believe satan s millennial rebellion will occur after the one zero zero zero year peace on the other hand those who did not believe in the millennium also imagined the end of the world as chaotic and catastrophic the word apocalypse has been used for this final phase of human history as we know it with armageddon as the site of the last decisive battle on the day of judgement an or the apocalypse from greek <UNK> off from away un and <UNK> cover is in the judeo christian tradition a revelation of god s purposes with the main intention of encouraging an oppressed and suffering minority to have faith in god and of proclaiming his ultimate triumph in particular the revelation of the future granted to st john one of the four evangelists in the isle of patmos written in greek in the one st century ad and burning with the conviction that the world is about to be destroyed and that christ s second coming is at hand hence the last book of the new testament the revelation of st john the book of revelation which contains it hence the total destruction and end of the world the book of revelation is not easy to interpret numerous painters and sculptors have produced works of art dealing with the apocalypse for example they portrayed the four horsemen of the apocalypse symbolizing pestilence war famine and death <UNK> and <UNK> the early christian concept had ramifications far beyond strictly religious concern during the centuries to come as it was blended and enhanced with ideas of utopia in the wake of early millennial thinking the three ages philosophy <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> developed making use of the dogma of the trinity the italian monk and theologian joachim of fiore d one two zero two claimed that all of human history was a succession of three ages the age of the father the old testament the age of the son the new testament the age of the holy spirit the age of love peace and freedom it was believed that the age of the holy spirit would begin at around one two six zero and that from then on all believers would be living as monks <UNK> <UNK> and full of praise for god for a thousand years until judgement day would put an end to the history of our planet in the modern era with the impact of religion on everyday life gradually decreasing and eventually almost vanishing some of the concepts of millennial thinking have found their way into various secular ideas usually in the form of a belief that a certain historical event will fundamentally change human society or has already done so for example the french revolution seemed to many to be ushering in the millennial age of reason also the philosophies of georg wilhelm friedrich hegel d one eight three one and karl marx d one eight eight three carried strong millennial overtones as late as one nine seven zero yale law teacher charles a reich coined the term consciousness iii in his best seller the <UNK> of america in which he spoke of a new age ushered in by the hippie generation however these secular theories generally have little or nothing to do with the original millennial thinking or with each other <UNK> and nazism the most controversial interpretation of the three ages philosophy and of <UNK> in general is hitler s third reich <UNK> reich <UNK> <UNK> reich which in his vision would last for a thousand years but which in reality only lasted for one two years one nine three three one nine four five the phrase third reich was coined by

use of vector graphics like postscript svg and pdf especially when combined with program code allows flash files to translate to small file sizes which take less bandwidth to transmit than <UNK> or video clips do in many cases flash is a very attractive solution for delivering mixed content if the content is purely one format such as text video or audio other alternatives may provide better outcome also depending on the type of application or animation created in particular transparency or large screen updates as in photographic or text fades a flash movie may need more cpu power than alternatives in addition to a vector rendering engine the flash player includes a virtual machine called the <UNK> virtual machine avm for scripting interactivity at run time support for video mp

also macromedia flash lite for flash compatibility on other devices macromedia has released the specifications of the flash file format excluding specifications of related formats such as amf and compatible third party tools exist however macromedia retains control of the format since flash files do not depend on a truly open standard such as svg this reduces the incentive for non commercial software to support the format although there are several third party tools which utilize and generate the <UNK> file format and a large and vibrant open source community apparently the flash player cannot ship as part of a pure open source or completely free operating system as its distribution is bound to the macromedia licensing program and subject to approval authoring using macromedia flash

ming library exist to produce <UNK> files on many platforms macromedia has made the flash files specifications for versions six and later available only as a pdf under a non disclosure agreement but is widely available from various sites many shareware developers produced flash creation tools and sold them for under five zero usd between two zero zero zero and two zero zero two in two zero zero

to raise their prices although many of the products still cost less than one zero zero usd and support <UNK> as for open source tools flash four linux has started to develop a <UNK> authoring tool including an interface similar to that of macromedia s <UNK> can edit vectors and generate <UNK> but its interface is very different from macromedia s adobe wrote a software package called adobe <UNK>

confused with <UNK> and <UNK> in addition as of version two apple s keynote presentation software also allows users to create interactive presentations and export to <UNK> in november two zero zero three microsoft announced that it had started working on a competing product now called microsoft expression interactive designer whose release would coincide with that of their next generation windows operating system windows vista although the target audiences of expression interaction designer and flash overlap somewhat microsoft is targeting its product on creating user interfaces for windows presentation foundation programs while flash focuses on user interfaces that run on many platforms primarily over the web abuse probably due to wide usage of flash in web advertisements tools have emerged for blocking flash content in some or all web sites or temporarily or permanently turning flash player off for example <UNK> <UNK> com s disable flash <UNK> flash page and <UNK> for the mozilla firefox browser many web sites rely on flash being available by default on your browser and will not check if you have disabled it you may be unable to access a particular website if you disable flash or experience a degraded user interface macintosh performance macromedia has been criticized for neglecting to optimize its products on the mac os x platform this has led to poor web surfing performance on macintosh computers since many websites use flash animations for menus and advertisements macromedia has rewritten the bitmap drawing routines in flash player eight using opengl

control is a general term for a number of controversial theories proposing that an individual s thinking behavior emotions or decisions can to a greater or lesser extent be manipulated at will by outside sources the principal feasibility of such control and the methods by which it might be attained either direct or more subtle are both subject to hot debates among psychologists <UNK> and sociologists also the exact definition of mind control and the extent of its influence on the individual are debated the different views on the subject do have legal implications mind control was an issue e g in the court case of patty hearst and also in several court cases regarding new religious movements also questions of mind control are regarding ethical questions linked to the subject of free will the question of mind control has been discussed in relation with religion politics prisoners of war totalitarianism neural cell manipulation cults terrorism torture parental alienation and even in regards to the battered woman syndrome while mind control remains a controversial subject the principal possibility of influences on individuals by methods like advertising media manipulation propaganda group dynamics or peer pressure has been well researched in social psychology and is today undisputed electromagnetic manipulation of neurons since the discovery that neural cells could be fired by establishing a potential voltage across a neural cell membrane in the one nine three zero s has been suggested as a technology the belief that one is being manipulated or controlled by outside forces is also recognized as one of the hallmarks of paranoid delusional complexes and other <UNK> typically these delusions are of invasive and complete control by entities as diverse as orbiting government satellites television sets animals aliens or angels and demons those who suffer from this delusion may cling to it despite a complete lack of evidence of anything that might be controlling them psychiatric therapy with anti psychotic medication can often end the delusion or at least mitigate its severity in some cases however especially in cases of involuntary commitment the person may view treatment with anti <UNK> as yet another form of mind control this should not be taken to imply that mere belief in the existence of mind control is an indicator of psychosis belief in the mere existence of mind control is wide spread it is only a sign of psychosis when the belief becomes an obsessive fixation theoretical models and methods there are several and very different methods which were suggested for achieving mind control none of these methods have been universally accepted in the science community theology ideology and identity authors joel kramer and diana <UNK> suggest that mind control is embedded in the very fabric of contemporary religious political and social power through the <UNK> reliance on false but <UNK> authoritarian ideas they show how concepts such as religious truth goodness versus <UNK> and unconditional love to name a few can be used to control and divide people s minds they also study the authoritarian programming by which so called normal people worldwide fall prey to status quo authoritarian ideas using well known guru mind control methods as a basis for comparison failed attempts drugs physical methods silva method the cia program <UNK> made from one nine five zero tried to achieve mind control through drugs drugs used in experiments were lsd or heroin mescaline psilocybin <UNK> marijuana alcohol and sodium <UNK> or a combination of barbiturates and amphetamine or ecstasy other theories have been based on the use of antidepressant drugs and mood stabilizers which have a definite effect on mood through what is believed to be a direct action on the chemistry of the brain however most people would not say that this constituted mind control and people taking these drugs do not feel controlled in the <UNK> program radiation and <UNK> were tested but apparently did not achieve any sort of mind control with intense modern magnets and the technique of <UNK> magnetic stimulation tms or repetitive tms <UNK> researchers have succeeded in <UNK> suppressing certain thought processes such as the conjugation of verbs with fleeting magnetic pulses to specific areas of the brain the technique has proved a valuable tool for testing hypotheses about the role and interplay between brain regions in particular cognitive activities and psychiatric symptoms such as depression tests with elf technology are better documented from the one nine five zero s to the one nine seven zero s both the soviet union and the united states carried out several experiments using elf pulse transmissions to mimic human nerve impulses in effect <UNK> certain states of consciousness particularly emotions by radiation scientists found that certain elf frequencies when transmitted in pulse mode could induce emotions in subjects any further going conclusions from these results belong rather in the field of conspiracy theories than of science but this too begs the question as it would be quite naive to assume no one has ever conspired to develop technologies useful for controlling others <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> e g a former finnish physician and a well known <UNK> and conspiracy theorist sees many <UNK> as <UNK> victims of mind control experiments physical implants discovered in the cerebral tissue of such <UNK> have allegedly substantiated such claims in the one nine six zero s jos silva made known the silva mind control method later silva method which uses a combination of positive thinking visualization meditation and self hypnosis and claims that its application can achieve psychic abilities remote viewing and healing none of which is empirically proven subliminal advertising outline subliminal advertising is an unproven method of mind control in which messages are relayed to the public by being hidden in broadcasted advertisements tv radio shows and movies subliminal advertising has been discovered often by chance in media around the world though it is denied some common methods include carefully wording a radio advertisement so your hear something different when it is played backwards the theory is that your brain registers the hidden message even though you don t realize it another common technique is to add one frame of video in the middle of a movie or tv show while it flashes by too quickly to be registered by your conscious your eyes still detect it and it registers in your brain one of the more serious sides of subliminal advertising is the fact that it is theoretically possible to control people s behaviour for example if a drinks company were to utilise it anyone watching or listening to the advert may be compelled to purchase that drink for a supposedly unknown reason it is also claimed it can control political ideology and even tendency to commit crime of course none of this has been proven but in the ruthless world of business some people will try anything subliminal advertising is the same as subliminal messaging although the latter is not designed to promote something james <UNK> coined the term subliminal advertising the publication in one nine five seven of vance packard s the hidden <UNK> brought the term to the attention of the general public in one nine seven three the book subliminal seduction claimed that advertising made widespread use of subliminal techniques and could in theory be used as a form of mind control <UNK> brainwashing model psychiatrist robert <UNK> described in his one nine six one book thought reform and the psychology of <UNK> a study of brainwashing in china eight coercive methods which he says are able to change the minds of individuals without their knowledge and were used with this purpose on prisoners of war in korea and china these include milieu control controlled relations with the outer world mystic manipulation the group has a higher purpose than the rest confession confess past and present sins self sanctification through purity pushing the individual towards a not attainable perfection aura of sacred science beliefs of the group are <UNK> and perfect loaded language new meanings to words encouraging black white thinking doctrine over person the group is more important than the individual dispensed existence insiders are saved outsiders are doomed in his one nine nine nine book destroying the world to save it <UNK> <UNK> apocalyptic violence and the new global terrorism he concluded though that thought reform was possible without violence or physical coercion edgar <UNK> who investigated similar programs in china concluded in his book coercive persuasion that physical coercion was an important feature of brainwashing margaret singer s conditions for mind control psychologist margaret singer using the work of <UNK> described in her book cults in our midst six conditions which would she says create an atmosphere where thought reform is possible singer sees no need for physical coercion or violence controlling a person s time and environment leaving no time for thought creating a sense of <UNK> fear and dependency manipulating rewards and punishments to suppress former social behaviour manipulating rewards and punishments to elicit the desired behaviour creating a closed system of logic which makes dissenters feel as if something was wrong with them keeping recruits unaware about any agenda to control or change them bite model of steven hassan psychologist and cult counselor steven hassan using the research of singer and <UNK> and the cognitive dissonance theory of leon <UNK> describes in his two zero zero zero book releasing the bonds the bite behavior information thought emotion model which explains mind control as a combination of control over behavior information thought and emotions according to hassan the bite model <UNK> with any required environment control and its effects can be achieved when the control mechanisms create overall dependency and obedience to some leader or cause hassan s critics argue that steve hassan uses the term mind control for what they see as essentially a strong form of influence only to justify the forcible extraction of believers from religious groups they argue that hassan does not merely say that fraudulent <UNK> persuaded the believers he claims that these groups literally take away a victim s freedom of mind for this reason an involuntary procedure must operate in order to rescue a victim from a destructive cult for victims may not realize their <UNK> status and may resist rescuing hassan after taking part in a number of <UNK> in the late one nine seven zero s distances himself from this practice and the criminal activities associated with that occupation and refers to his method as strategic interaction mind control and the battered woman syndrome a very different explanation of the control some groups have over their members is by associating it to the battered woman syndrome this has been done by psychologists teresa ramirez <UNK> ph d and susan m andersen ph d as well as by former <UNK> robert vaughn young evolutionary psychology approach battered women syndrome is an example of activating capture bonding capture bonding is understood in evolutionary psychology as an evolved response to capture in the last few million years cults such as scientology tap this psychological trait by abusive practices <UNK> that have the same paradoxical effect of bonding victims to the abusers in addition the intense attention rewards cults focus on members has brain effects nearly identical to drug addiction in some people social psychology tactics a contemporary view of mind control sees it as an intensified and persistent use of well researched social psychology principles like compliance conformity persuasion dissonance reactance framing or emotional manipulation one of the most notable proponents of this theory is social psychologist philip <UNK> former president of the american psychological association i conceive of mind control as a phenomena encompassing all the ways in which personal social and institutional forces are exerted to induce compliance conformity belief attitude and value change in others mind control is the process by which individual or collective freedom of choice and action is compromised by agents or agencies that modify or distort perception motivation affect cognition and or behavioral outcomes it is neither magical nor mystical but a process that involves a set of basic social psychological principles in influence science and practice social psychology researcher robert <UNK> shows how mind control is possible through the covert exploitation of the unconscious rules that <UNK> and facilitate healthy human social interactions he notes the most common social rules that can be used to prey upon the <UNK> and titles them as follows <UNK> the old give and take and take commitment and consistency <UNK> of the mind social proof truths are us liking the friendly thief authority directed deference scarcity the rule of the few using these six broad categories he shows many specific examples of both mild and extreme mind control both one on one and in groups notes the conditions under which each social rule is most easily exploited for false ends and offers suggestions on how to fight these <UNK> and often unconscious mind control methods social psychological conditioning by <UNK> anthony <UNK> identifies five phases of social psychological conditioning which he calls cult like conditioning techniques employed by terrorist groups <UNK> two zero zero four <UNK> stripping away all other group member identities self <UNK> stripping away each member s personal identity other <UNK> stripping away the personal identities of enemies <UNK> identifying enemies as <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> identifying enemies as evil cults and mind control controversies several of the above mind control models have been related to religious and non religious cults for debates regarding what is a cult see the article among scholars adherents of <UNK> and the pro cult and anti cult communities it is hotly debated if mind control is applied in any or certain cultic movements scholarly points of view while in science of religion the majority of scholars reject mind control e g massimo <UNK> and j gordon melton it is often accepted in psychology and psychiatry e g margaret singer michael <UNK> and philip <UNK> and in sociology the opinions are divided e g david g <UNK> and anson <UNK> contra stephen a kent and benjamin <UNK> pro most scholars have either a decided contra or a decided pro opinion there are few who advocate a moderate point of view the renowned medical journal the lancet as well as the american journal of psychiatry published favorable reviews of steven hassan s one nine eight eight book on mind control according to james t richardson on his brainwashing claims and minority religions outside the united states cultural diffusion of a questionable concept in the legal arena while heavy on theory the mind control model is light on evidence the <UNK> movement has collected some information to support its belief that religious groups successfully employ mind control techniques but the data is unreliable the information typically represents a very small sample size it is not practical to obtain information before during and after an individual has been in a <UNK> often their data is disproportionately obtained from former members of a religious organization who have been convinced during <UNK> counseling that they have been victims of mind control dr james richardson a professor of sociology and judicial studies at the university of nevada claims that if the <UNK> had access to powerful brainwashing techniques one would expect that <UNK> would have high growth rates while in fact most have not had notable success in recruitment most adherents participate for only a short time and that the success in retaining members has been limited in addition thomas robbins eileen barker newton <UNK> massimo <UNK> john hall <UNK> dawson anson <UNK> david g <UNK> gordon melton marc <UNK> saul levine and other scholars researching <UNK> have argued and established to the satisfaction of courts and relevant professional associations and scientific communities that there exists no scientific theory generally accepted and based upon <UNK> sound research that supports the brainwashing theories as advanced by the anti cult movement on the other hand sociologist benjamin <UNK> sees strong indicators of mind control in some <UNK> and demands the concept should be researched without bias i am not personally opposed to the existence of <UNK> and still less to the free exercise of religious conscience i would fight actively against any governmental attempt to limit freedom of religious expression nor do i believe it is within the competence of secular scholars such as myself to evaluate or judge the cultural worth of spiritual beliefs or spiritual actions however i am convinced based on more than three decades of studying <UNK> through participant observation and through interviews with both members and ex members that these movements have unleashed social and psychological forces of truly awesome power these forces have <UNK> havoc in many lives in both adults and in children it is these social and psychological influence processes that the social scientist has both the right and the duty to try to understand regardless of whether such understanding will ultimately prove helpful or harmful to the cause of religious liberty <UNK> one nine nine seven sociologists david <UNK> and anson <UNK> consider the idea that cult s are brainwashing american youth to be implausible on the other hand the canadian sociology professor stephen a kent published several articles where he relays practices of <UNK> with brainwashing the american psychological association apa in one nine eight four requested margaret singer the main proponent of anti cult mind control theories to set up a working group called task force on deceptive and indirect methods of persuasion and control <UNK> in one nine eight seven the <UNK> committee submitted its final report to the board of social and ethical responsibility for psychology of the apa on may one one one nine eight seven the board rejected the report in the rejection memo is stated finally after much consideration <UNK> does not believe that we have sufficient information available to guide us in taking a position on this issue there are two interpretations of this rejection one side e g <UNK> and di <UNK> two zero zero zero and <UNK> two zero zero one see it as no position on the issue of brainwashing the other e g <UNK> one nine nine seven sees it as rejecting all brainwashing theories in two zero zero two dr philip <UNK> who teaches at stanford university a course the psychology of mind control commented on the request by former members of new religious movements <UNK> to reconsider the apa s position on the possibility of mind control recently there are indications that some members of both parties are willing to start a dialog e g the two zero zero one book misunderstanding cults searching for objectivity in a controversial field in two zero zero two the american family foundation invited eileen barker to its yearly conference and the evangelical ministries to new religions had j gordon melton and douglas cowan as conference speakers mind control and exit counseling opponents of some new religious movements accused so called cult s of <UNK> recruits to join and members to remain via strong influence acquired and maintained by manipulation see also anti cult movement and christian countercult movement many of these opponents advocate exit counseling as necessary to free the victim of a cult from mind control the practice of coercive deprogramming has practically ceased kent tyler <UNK> former president of the unification church estimates approximately one zero zero zero zero zero people moved into the unification church as full time members from the one nine seven zero s to the one nine nine zero s membership in the church was eight six zero zero in two zero zero four counting only those who joined as adults and excluding the children of members this is an attrition rate of nine three billy graham one of the most successful evangelists of the last century had only an average of one of the attendants of his <UNK> heed the altar call at all follow up work after <UNK> shows that only one zero of the people responding to an altar call actually do join a church so successful christian <UNK> result in a <UNK> success rate of zero one compared to the four of barker s observation and these zero one do not become <UNK> missionaries like in the unification church <UNK> one nine nine three mind control and faith the american civil liberties union aclu published a statement in one nine seven seven related to brainwashing and mind control in this statement the aclu opposed certain methods depriving people of the free exercise of religion the aclu also rejected under certain conditions the idea that claims of the use of brainwashing or of mind control should overcome the free exercise of religion leon <UNK> based his theory of the cognitive dissonance a component of hassan s mind control model on his observation that the faith of most members of a ufo cult was <UNK> by failed prophecy barrett who is affiliated with <UNK> and eileen barker whom some anti cult activists consider cult apologists wrote that logical arguments are irrelevant when trying to persuade some members to leave a movement due to the certainty that they have about their faith which he sees as not confined to cults but also occurring in some forms of mainstream religion he also wrote that some members do not leave the movement even though they realize that things are wrong see also leaving a cult counter cult movement and mind control in the christian counter cult movement there are several voices explaining membership in christian and non christian cults exclusively with a theological regarding spiritual problems and therefore refuting mind control as a factor in cult membership in an article by the evangelical christian writers bob and gretchen <UNK> first appearing in cornerstone magazine titled overcoming the bondage of <UNK> a critical evaluation of cult mind control theories they challenge the validity of mind control theories and the alleged <UNK> by mind control and assert in their conclusion the <UNK> man of cult mind control is nothing but a ghost story good for inducing an adrenaline high and maintaining a crusade but irrelevant to reality the reality is that people who have very real spiritual emotional and social needs are looking for fulfillment and significance for their lives ill equipped to test the false gospels of this world they make poor decisions about their religious affiliations poor decisions yes but decisions for which they are personally responsible nonetheless as christians who believe in an absolute standard of truth and religious reality we cannot ignore the spiritual threat of the cults we must promote critical thinking responsible education biblical apologetics and christian evangelism we must recognize that those who join the cults while morally responsible are also spiritually ignorant in a rebuttal to the <UNK> s article a protagonist of the counter cult movement paul r martin ph d et al in his overcoming the bondage of <UNK> a rational empirical defense of thought reform first appeared in cultic studies journal one five two one nine nine eight writes the <UNK> are well known and respected evangelical writers consequently their critique which is rife with errors and <UNK> <UNK> us very much and calls for a detailed rebuttal for us theological considerations inform our understanding of the sociological and psychological destruction caused by cults although others hold similar positions without considering theological issues cults distort one s perceptions both of natural reality sociological and psychological and spiritual reality in the christian tradition the former is supposed to reveal the latter therefore those interested in spiritual issues must address both sides in order to minister adequately to former cult members legal issues some persons have claimed a brainwashing defense for crimes committed while purportedly under mind control in the cases of patty hearst steven <UNK> and lee boyd <UNK> the court rejected such defenses also in the court cases against members of <UNK> <UNK> regarding the one nine nine five <UNK> gas attack on the tokyo subway system the mind control defense was not a mitigating factor starting from the <UNK> case one nine nine zero where a defendant accused of commercial fraud raised as a defense that he was not fully responsible since he was under the mind control of scientology american courts consistently rejected testimonies about mind control and manipulation stating that these were not part of accepted mainline science according to the frye standard anthony during trial <UNK> s experts testified scientology s auditing and <UNK> practices constituted brainwashing and thought reform akin to what the chinese and north koreans practiced on american prisoners of war a religious practice which takes place in the context of this level of coercion has less religious value than one the recipient engages in voluntarily even more significantly it poses a greater threat to society to have coerced religious practices inflicted on its citizens using its position as religious leader the church and its agents coerced <UNK> into continuing auditing even though his sanity was repeatedly threatened by this practice thus there is adequate proof the religious practice in this instance caused real harm to the individual and the <UNK> s outrageous conduct caused that harm church practices conducted in a coercive environment are not qualified to be voluntary religious practices entitled to first amendment religious freedom guarantees in one nine nine three the european court of human rights upheld the right of a greek jehovah s witness minos <UNK> who had been sentenced to prison and a fine for proselytizing to spread his faith though the court sought to define what it regarded as acceptable ways of sharing one s faith however in a dissenting judgment two judges argued that <UNK> and his wife had applied unacceptable psychological techniques akin to brainwashing <UNK> v greece one four three zero seven eight eight one nine nine three <UNK> two zero two five may one nine nine three mind control against children in parental alienation stanley <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> have claimed in children held hostage dealing with programmed and <UNK> children that many forms of mind control are used in parental alienation by one parent against the other parent using both parents children as <UNK> weapons this use of mind control is often devastating to children and follows them into adulthood by creating a chronic condition known as parental alienation syndrome in addition the mind control used in parental alienation often <UNK> damages or destroys the target parent s bonds with his or her children mind control in conspiracy theory some discredit these views as possible symptoms of schizophrenia and sometimes of other forms of psychosis include the belief that one is subject to external mind control often by use of some form of technology were there any validity to the theories this would certainly generate fear in any parties who knew of such technology from speaking up principles behind such devices have been proposed because of study in the one nine three zero s of the neural cells of the giant squid which are similar to those of humans but much larger it is known that establishing a potential energy field across a neuron or neural cell membrane will cause it to fire seventy five years of understanding of this fact lends support that devices could have been devised to affect human mental and bodily function using external energy sources these often involve proposed mind control technologies such as the use of microwave radiation or lasers to control thoughts often by intelligence agencies and by secret societies mind control is a common feature in many conspiracy theories as it provides a mechanism by which an alleged conspiracy could maintain control over innocent people prevent knowledge of the conspiracy s actions and in some cases prevent the conspiracy theorist s intended audience from believing him of course naming a theory as a conspiracy theory does not disprove it political conspiracies have existed in the past and certainly will in the future the means by which victims are alleged to be controlled varies according to the nature of the theory theories centering on existing governmental groups usually feature mind control via subliminal messages or other technological means while theories focusing on non human entities extraterrestrials demons invisible masters and organised secret societies such as the freemasons black dragon society or the illuminati are more likely to involve supernatural or magical means or particularly fanciful technology such as mind control satellites theories that involve the united states government frequently refer to <UNK> radio waves are frequently claimed to be used for mind control radio and television broadcast towers and more recently cell phone towers are often considered suspect j d salinger s novel the catcher in the rye was rumored to be a device for fbi cia mind control at one time based on the apparent coincidence of lee harvey oswald and mark chapman owning a copy seeing as this has always been a popular novel among intelligent and alienated young men however this coincidence of ownership is hardly surprising nevertheless there is a large fringe literature on the supposed mind control subtext of catcher in the rye mind control in fiction mind control has proven a popular subject in fiction featuring in books and films such as the <UNK> file and the manchurian candidate which has the premise that controllers could <UNK> a person into

pact or nazi soviet pact and formally known as the treaty of <UNK> between germany and the union of soviet socialist republics was a non aggression treaty between the german third reich and the soviet union it was signed in moscow on august two three one nine three nine by the soviet foreign minister vyacheslav molotov and the german foreign minister joachim von ribbentrop the mutual non aggression treaty lasted until operation barbarossa of june two two one nine four one when nazi germany invaded the soviet union although officially labelled a non aggression treaty the pact included a secret protocol in which the independent countries of finland estonia latvia lithuania poland and romania were divided into spheres of interest of the parties the secret protocol explicitly assumed territorial and political <UNK> in the areas of these countries which practically rendered it into an aggressive military alliance in spite of its official name subsequently all the mentioned countries were invaded by either the soviets the nazis or both only finland which fought twice against the soviet union in wwii successfully resisted conquest but was forced to concede territory background in one nine one eight by the treaty of brest litovsk the new bolshevik russian state accepted the loss of sovereignty and influence over finland estonia latvia lithuania poland belarus and ukraine plus parts of armenia and georgia as a concession to the central powers in accordance with the <UNK> policy they were designated to become satellite states to or parts of the german empire with dukes and kings related to the german emperor as a consequence of the german defeat in the autumn of one nine one eight and not without active support from the allied victors of the world war most of them became democratic republics but also proxies for france and britain against the bolsheviks in the russian civil war with the exception of belarus and ukraine all of these countries also became independent and fully sovereign however in many cases independence was followed by civil wars related to the russian revolution in the one nine two zero s fear of russia and of communism motivated attempts to foster political cooperation and defense treaties between these so called border states molotov signs the german soviet non aggression pact behind him are ribbentrop and stalin the european balance of power established at the end of world war i was eroded step by step from the abyssinia crisis one nine three five to the munich agreement one nine three eight the dissolution of czechoslovakia signaled increasing instability as nazi germany the soviet union and other countries such as hungary and bulgaria aspired to regain territories lost in the aftermath of world war i the western democracies britain and france notional <UNK> of the territorial status quo stood by until the march one nine three nine destruction of czechoslovakia maintaining a policy of non intervention while the fascist governments of germany and italy supported the victorious right wing rebels in their destruction of the democratic spanish republic in the spanish civil war of one nine three six three nine for the soviet union the molotov ribbentrop pact was a much needed response to the deterioration of the european security situation in the latter half of the one nine three zero s as nazi germany aligned with fascist italy in the axis powers aimed to reverse the <UNK> treaty of versailles after world war i in addition the ongoing soviet japanese border war of one nine three nine culminating in the battle of <UNK> <UNK> may have been a significant consideration for the soviets for whom a two front war was an anathema the pact may in fact have influenced the japanese to seek a cease fire two weeks after the pact s announcement for its part the soviet union was not interested in maintaining a status quo which it saw as <UNK> to its interests deriving as it did from the period of soviet weakness immediately following the one nine one seven october revolution and russian civil war soviet leaders adopted the position that conflict between what they characterized as rival imperialist countries was not only an inevitable consequence of capitalism but would also enhance conditions for the spread of communism this strategy worked out well for the victorious soviets who spread communism into eastern europe after the countries were weakened during world war ii during one nine three eight the soviet union as well as france offered to abide by their defensive military alliance with czechoslovakia in the event of german invasion but the czechoslovakian agrarian party was so strongly opposed to soviet troops entering the country that they threatened a civil war might result if they did the one nine three five agreement between the soviet union czechoslovakia and france stipulated that soviet aid could only come to czechoslovakia if france came to their aid as well the reluctance of the western democracies to form an anti fascist alliance with the ussr and france and britain s pact with hitler signed at munich was indicative of a lack of interest from the side of the west to oppose the growing fascist movement already exemplified by the events of the spanish civil war the soviets were not invited to the munich conference of september one nine three eight when the french and british prime ministers <UNK> and chamberlain agreed to the dismemberment of czechoslovakia as the french had not honoured their one nine two four treaty with the czechs the soviets concluded that their one nine three five alliance with france was <UNK> and that the west was trying to divert germany to the east in march one nine three nine hitler s denunciation of the one nine three four german polish non aggression pact was taken by the soviets as a clear signal of hitler s aggressive intentions <UNK> in april outlined a french british soviet alliance with military commitment against fascist powers but chamberlain s government <UNK> partly because the soviets demanded too much a guarantee to the baltic states complete reciprocity and the right to send troops through poland however chamberlain who already on two four march had with france guaranteed the sovereignty of poland now on two five april signed a pact of mutual assistance with poland consequently stalin no longer feared that the west would leave the soviet union to fight hitler alone indeed if germany and the west went to war as seemed likely the ussr could afford to remain neutral and wait for them to destroy each other franco british negotiations with the soviet union negotiations between the soviet union france and britain for a military alliance against germany stalled mainly due to mutual suspicions the soviet union sought guarantees for support against german aggression and recognition of the right of the soviet union to interfere against a change of policy favorable to an aggressor in the countries along the western soviet border although none of the affected countries had formally asked for protection by the soviet union it nevertheless announced guarantees for the independence of finland estonia latvia poland romania turkey and greece the so called sanitary cordon erected between nazi germany and the soviet union the british and french feared that this would allow soviet intervention in neighboring countries internal affairs even in the absence of an immediate external german threat however with the third reich now demanding territorial concessions from poland in the face of polish opposition the threat of war was increasing but although telegrams were exchanged between the western powers and the soviet union as early as april one nine three nine the military missions sent by the western powers with a slow transport vessel did not arrive in moscow until august one one and were given no authority to sign a treaty the fundamental sticking point was the question of poland lying between germany and the soviet union the polish government rightly feared that the soviet government sought to annex the disputed territories of <UNK> incorporated in poland in one nine two zero after the polish soviet war characterized by the kremlin as <UNK> western ukraine and western belarus since parts of them were inhabited by ethnically ukrainian and belarusian majorities respectively and the majority of the population of then western poland was non polish therefore the polish government refused to allow the soviet military to enter its territory and establish military bases in preparation for the now inevitable war with germany a situation that allegedly left the red army without any possibility of confronting the germans before poland was invaded three weeks into august the negotiations ground to a halt with each side doubting the other s motives and the kremlin <UNK> that they were being led into a conflict limited to the ussr and germany the munich agreement and soviet foreign policy defenders of the soviet position argue that the soviet union entered the non aggression pact after the september one nine three eight munich agreement had made it evident that the western countries were pursuing a policy of appeasement and were not interested in joining the soviet union in an anti fascist alliance promoted through their popular front tactic in addition there was concern about the possibility that france and britain would stay neutral in a war initiated by germany hoping that the warring states would wear each other out and put an end to both the soviet union and the nazis biographers of stalin point out that he believed the british rejected his proposal of an anti fascist alliance because they were plotting with nazi germany against the soviet union and that the western democracies were expecting the third reich to attack communist russia and were hoping that the nazi forces would wipe out the soviet union or that both countries would fight each other to the point of exhaustion and then collapse these suspicions were reinforced when chamberlain and hitler met for the munich agreement the defenders of the soviet position also argue it was necessary to enter into a non aggression pact to buy time since the soviet union was not in a position to fight a war in one nine three nine and needed at least three years to prepare this argument matches the views of stalin s critics who maintain that one reason why the soviet union was not in a position to fight a war was stalin s great purge of one nine three six to one nine three eight which among other things eliminated much of the military s most experienced leadership a well known fact is that when german forces finally did attack the soviet union on june two two one nine four one the red army was completely unprepared for the assault despite multiple advanced warnings from foreign as well as from soviet intelligence critics of stalin question his determination to oppose germany s growing military aggressiveness since the soviet union began commercial and military cooperation with germany in one nine three six and grew these relationships until the german invasion began after the british and french declaration of war on germany these economic relationships allowed germany to circumvent the allied naval blockade thus allowing it to avoid the disastrous <UNK> it faced in ww one nazi soviet rapprochement the prussian tribute in moscow satirical newspaper <UNK> september eight one nine three nine warsaw on three may one nine three nine the soviet secretary general joseph stalin replaced maxim <UNK> a jew by nationality with molotov as foreign minister thereby opening for negotiations with nazi germany <UNK> had been associated with the previous policy of creating an anti fascist coalition and was considered pro western by the standards of the kremlin molotov let it be known that he would welcome a peaceful settlement of issues with germany according to paul <UNK> stalin s address to the eighteenth congress of the communist party of the soviet union on one zero march one nine three nine discounted any idea of german designs on the soviet union stalin had intended to be cautious and not allow our country to be drawn into conflicts by <UNK> who are accustomed to have others pull the <UNK> out of the fire for them this was intended to warn the western democratic powers that they could not necessarily rely upon the support of the soviet union as mr <UNK> put it stalin was publicly making the none too subtle implication that some form of deal between the soviet union and germany could not be ruled out during the last two weeks of august one nine three nine the soviet japanese border war reached its peak at hitler s suggestion the german foreign minister ribbentrop visited moscow on one nine august one nine three nine a seven year german soviet trade agreement establishing economic ties between the two states was signed for a german credit to the soviet union of two zero zero million marks in exchange for raw materials petrol grain cotton phosphates and timber molotov then proposed an additional protocol covering the points in which the high contracting parties are interested in the field of foreign policy this was thought by some to have been precipitated by the alleged stalin s speech on august one nine one nine three nine where he supposedly asserted that a great war between the western powers was necessary for the spread of world revolution on august two two moscow revealed that ribbentrop will be visiting stalin the next day this happened while russians still pretended negotiating a military pact with the british and french missions in moscow instead a secret nazi soviet alliance emerged on august two four a one zero year non aggression pact was signed with provisions that included consultation arbitration if either party disagreed neutrality if either went to war against a third power no membership of a group which is directly or indirectly aimed at the other however there was also a secret protocol to the pact revealed only on germany s defeat in one nine four five according to which the states of northern and eastern europe were divided into german and soviet spheres of influence in the north finland estonia and latvia were apportioned to the soviet sphere poland was to be partitioned in the event of its political rearrangement the areas east of the rivers <UNK> vistula and san going to the soviet union while the germans would occupy the west lithuania adjacent to east prussia would be in the german sphere of influence in the south the soviet union s interest and german lack of interest in bessarabia a part of romania were acknowledged the german diplomat hans von <UNK> informed his u s colleague charles <UNK> on the secret protocol on august two four but the information stopped at the desk of president franklin roosevelt planned and actual territorial changes in central europe one nine three nine one nine four zero concerns over the possible existence of a secret appendix were first expressed in the intelligence organizations of the baltic states scant days after the pact was signed and the speculations grew stronger when soviet <UNK> referred to its content during negotiations for military bases in those countries the german original was presumably destroyed in the bombings but its <UNK> copy was included in the documents archive of the german foreign office karl von <UNK> a civil servant in foreign office gave this copy to british lt col r c thomson in may one nine four five the soviet union denied the existence of the secret protocols until one nine eight eight when politburo member alexander nikolaevich yakovlev admitted the existence of the protocols although the document itself was declassified only after the dissolution of the soviet union in one nine nine two stalin who had feared that the west was encouraging hitler to fight the east must have been aware that the secret clause was likely to <UNK> war because it freed hitler from the prospect of a war against the ussr while fighting france and britain the pact started to deteriorate in april one nine four zero when germany invaded denmark and norway and in june one nine four zero when the soviet union annexed not only bessarabia but also <UNK> from romania both nations were clearly <UNK> their defined spheres of influence as agreed to in the pact however in one nine four seven stalin said that he would have continued to work with germany had hitler been willing certainly stalin had more to gain from cooperation with germany e g poland than from cooperation with britain according to historian e h carr stalin was convinced that no german would be so foolish as to engage in hostilities on two fronts stalin therefore considered it axiomatic that if germany was at war with the west then it would have to be friendly with the soviet union soviet <UNK> as well as its representatives went to great lengths to minimize the importance of the fact that they had opposed and fought against the nazis in various ways for a decade prior to signing the pact however they never went as far as to take a pro german stance officially the molotov ribbentrop pact was worded as a non aggression treaty not a pact of alliance still it is said that upon signing the pact molotov tried to <UNK> the germans of his good intentions by commenting to journalists that fascism is a matter of taste the extent to which the soviet union s earlier territorial acquisitions may have contributed to preventing its fall and thus a nazi victory in the war remains a factor in evaluating the pact soviet sources pointed out that the german advance eventually stopped just a few kilometers away from moscow so the role of the extra territory might have been crucial in such a close call others say that poland and the baltic countries played the important role of buffer states between the soviet union and nazi germany and that the molotov ribbentrop pact was a precondition not only for germany s invasion of western europe but also for the third reich s invasion of the soviet union the military aspect of moving from established fortified positions on the stalin line into <UNK> polish territory could also be seen as one of the causes of rapid dissolution of soviet armed forces in one nine four one as the newly built molotov line was unfinished and unable to provide

governments which had most feared such an outcome and even more so among the communists themselves many of whom found these soviet dealings with their nazi enemy incomprehensible a famous cartoon by

serve the true interest of all peoples to put an end to the state of war existing at present between germany on the one side and england and france on the other both governments will therefore direct their common efforts jointly with other friendly powers if occasion arises toward attaining this goal as soon as possible should however the efforts of the two governments remain fruitless this would

union on november three zero after more than three months of heavy fighting and losses in the ensuing winter war the soviet union gave up its intended occupation of finland in exchange for approximately one zero of finland s territory most of which was still held by the finnish army on june one five one seven one nine four zero after the wehrmacht s swift occupation of norway denmark

and the romanian government s own <UNK> resulted in more territorial losses for romania the second vienna award orchestrated mainly by ribbentrop created a competition between romania and hungary for

many perished later these occupied territories were in the front line of the war and also suffered from the nazi terror behind the wwii eastern front by early one nine four one the german and soviet occupation zones shared a border running through what is now lithuania and poland nazi soviet relations began to cool again and the signs of a clash between the wehrmacht and the red army began to show in german propaganda a clash that was not without appeal to the populations in occupied western europe where the anti bolshevism from the times of the russian civil war twenty years before had not quite faded by appearing as the unifying leader of the west against the east hitler hoped for boosted popularity at home and abroad and an impetus for peace with britain meanwhile the soviet union was supporting germany in the war effort against western europe through the german soviet commercial agreement with supplies of raw materials phosphates chrome and iron ore mineral oil grain cotton rubber these and other supplies were being transported through soviet and occupied polish territories and allowed germany to circumvent the british naval blockade the third reich ended the molotov ribbentrop pact of august one nine three nine by invading the soviet union in operation barbarossa on june two two one nine four one together with romania and thus closing the western front and opening an eastern front that would ultimately lead to the defeat of germany after the launch of the german invasion the territories gained by the soviet union due to the molotov ribbentrop pact were lost in a matter of weeks and for example the baltic countries ended up as german protectorates the german attack was followed by a soviet pre emptive attack on finland on june two five starting the continuation war between finland and the soviet union alternative terms the most established term for the treaty is the molotov ribbentrop pact this term is for example used on more web pages than any other name however in the english speaking world the term nazi soviet pact has always been popular and has seemingly gained increasing popularity over time this term is particularly widely used in journalism and school books on history however in some contexts the term hitler stalin pact is more common and sometimes dominant translations from german and dutch some textbooks on history in works

magna carta placed certain checks on the absolute power of the english monarchs this article is about the one two one five english charter for other uses see magna carta disambiguation this article follows the usual academic style and refers to the document as magna carta rather than the magna carta magna carta latin for great charter literally great paper also known as magna carta <UNK> is an english one two one five charter which limited the power of english monarchs specifically king john from absolute rule magna carta was the result of disagreements between the pope and king john and his barons over the rights of the king magna carta required the king to renounce certain rights and respect certain legal procedures and to accept that the will of the king could be bound by law magna carta is widely considered to be the first step in a long historical process leading to the rule of constitutional law history of magna carta after the norman conquest in one zero six six and advances in the one two th century the english king had by one one nine nine become the most powerful monarch europe had ever seen this was due to a number of factors including the sophisticated centralised government created by the procedures of the new norman rulers combined with the native anglo saxon systems of governance as well as extensive anglo norman land holdings in normandy however after king john took power in the early one three th century a series of stunning failures on his part led the barons of england to revolt and place checks on the king s unlimited power the failures of king john were threefold first there was a general lack of respect for king john because of the way he took power there were two candidates to take the place of the previous king richard the lionheart when he died in one one nine nine john and his nephew arthur of brittany in normandy john captured arthur and imprisoned him and he was never heard from again although arthur s murder was never proven it was assumed and many saw it as a black mark against john that he would murder his own family to be king secondly after philip augustus the king of france seized most of the english holdings in france the english barons demanded of their king that he retake the land and while he attempted to do so eight years later the effort came to failure at the battle of bouvines in one two one four john was given the nickname of <UNK> not because of this loss but because he had received no land rights in the continental provinces unlike his elder brothers in french he is known as jean sans terre john without land the third failure of john was when he became embroiled in a dispute with the church over the appointment of the office of archbishop of canterbury john wanted to appoint his own archbishop and the church wanted to appoint stephen langton this struggle went on for several years during which england was placed under a sentence of interdict and finally john was forced to submit to the will of the church in one two one three runnymede and afterwards by one two one five the barons of england had had enough they banded together and took london by force on june one zero one two one five they forced king john to agree to a document known as the articles of the barons to which his great seal was attached in the meadow at runnymede on june one five one two one five in return the barons renewed their oaths of fealty to king john on june one nine one two one five a formal document to record the agreement between king john and the barons was created by the royal chancery on july one five this was the original magna carta an unknown number of copies of this document were sent out to officials such as royal <UNK> and bishops the most significant clause for king john at the time was clause six one known as the security clause the longest portion of the entire document this established a committee of two five barons who could at any time meet and over rule the will of the king through force by seizing his castles and possessions if needed this was based on a medieval legal practice known as <UNK> which was commonly done but it was the first time it had been applied to a monarch in addition the king was to take an oath of loyalty to the committee king john had no intention of honouring magna carta as it was sealed under extortion by force and clause six one essentially <UNK> his powers as a monarch making him king in name only he renounced it as soon as the barons left london plunging england into a civil war known as the first barons war pope innocent iii also immediately annulled the shameful and demeaning agreement forced upon the king by violence and fear the pope rejected any call for rights saying it impaired king john s dignity john died in the middle of the civil war of dysentery on october one eight one two one six and it quickly changed the nature of the war his nine year old son king henry iii was next in line for the throne the royalists believed the rebel barons would find the idea of loyalty to the child henry more palatable and so the child was swiftly crowned in late october one two one six and the war ended on november one two one two one six magna carta was reissued in henry s name by his regents with some of the clauses including the contentious clause six one omitted magna carta was again reissued by henry s regents in one two one seven when he turned eighteen in one two two five henry iii himself reissued magna carta a third time this time in a shorter version with only three seven articles henry iii ruled for five six years the longest reign of an english monarch in the medieval period so that by the time of henry s death in one two seven two magna carta had become a settled part of english legal precedent and more difficult for a future monarch to <UNK> as king john had attempted nearly three generations earlier henry iii s son and heir edward i s parliament reissued magna carta for the final time on one two october one two nine seven as part of a statute known as <UNK> <UNK> two five <UNK> i <UNK> henry iii s shorter version of magna carta from one two two five magna carta of one two one five one of the certified copies of magna carta made in one two one five magna carta guaranteed certain english political liberties and contained clauses providing for a church free from domination by the monarchy reforming law and justice and controlling the behaviour of royal officials a large part of magna carta was copied nearly word for word from the charter of liberties of henry i issued when henry i ascended to the throne in one one zero zero which bound the king to certain laws regarding the treatment of church officials and nobles effectively granting certain civil liberties to the church and the english nobility magna carta is composed of six three different clauses or articles the majority of which are very specific to the one three th century and of temporary importance for example it repealed certain royal taxes that were unpopular and reduced the amount of hunting land that was royal and thus off limits to most nobles the text displays its origin as a product of negotiation haste and many hands one of the most important clauses that would have the longest lasting effect was article three nine according to which no free man shall be arrested or imprisoned or deprived of his property or outlawed or exiled or in any way destroyed nor shall we go against him or send against him unless by legal judgement of his peers or by the law of the land this meant the king must judge individuals according to the law and not according to his own will similarly article four zero stated to no one will we sell to no one will we refuse or delay right or justice these clauses were a check on the power of the king and the first step in the long road to a constitutional monarchy significance although the first version of magna carta remained in effect only a few weeks its reissue following john s death in autumn one two one six and the definite reissue of one two two five made it perpetual the first of england s statutes and a cornerstone of the british constitution henry iii and his successors evaded and broke provisions in the charters indeed the absolute power of the english monarchy despite magna carta actually grew during the medi val period for example in his historical play king john william shakespeare did not mention magna carta however a fundamental principle had been asserted and accepted by the king monarchy was subject to the law and the thirty <UNK> of magna carta during the medi val era reminded him of this fact even if he didn t always abide by it magna carta was not considered a particularly important document during the medi val period during which the power of the english crown grew the charter became increasingly important in the one seven th century as the conflict between the crown and parliament grew magna carta was repeatedly revised and other documents created such as the provisions of oxford guaranteeing greater rights to greater numbers of people thus setting the stage for the british constitutional monarchy the version of magna carta from one two nine seven is still part of english law although only part of the introductory sentences three articles and the ending remain in force the remaining three four articles have been repealed or superseded the articles currently in force are articles one nine and twenty nine of the one two nine seven version which are broadly similar to articles one thirteen thirty nine and forty of the one two one five version today magna carta has little practical legal use despite this it is still used in arguments about reform of the jury system many later attempts to draft constitutional forms of government including the united states constitution trace their lineage back to this source document the influence of magna carta can be clearly seen in the u s bill of rights which enumerates various rights of the people and restrictions on government power such as no person shall be deprived of life liberty or property without due process of law article two one from the declaration of rights in the maryland constitution of one seven seven six reads that no freeman ought to be taken or imprisoned or <UNK> of his freehold liberties or privileges or outlawed or exiled or in any manner destroyed or deprived of his life liberty or property but by the judgment of his peers or by the law of the land magna carta has influenced international law as well eleanor roosevelt referred to the universal declaration of human rights as a magna carta for all mankind magna carta and the jews in england magna carta contained two articles related to money lending and jews in england jewish involvement with money lending caused christian resentment because the church forbade the lending of money at interest known at the time as usury it was seen as vice such as gambling an un christian way to profit at others expense and was punishable by excommunication although jews as non christians could not be excommunicated and were thus in a legal grey area secular leaders unlike the church tolerated the practice of jewish usury because it gave the leaders opportunity for personal enrichment this resulted in a complicated legal situation debtors were frequently trying to bring their jewish creditors before church courts where debts would be <UNK> as illegal while the jews were trying to get their debtors tried in secular courts where they would be able to collect plus interest the relations between the debtors and creditors would often become very nasty there were many attempts over centuries to resolve this problem and magna carta contains one example of the legal code of the time on this issue if one who has borrowed from the jews any sum great or small die before that loan be repaid the debt shall not bear interest while the heir is under age of <UNK> he may hold and if the debt fall into our hands we will not take anything except the principal sum contained in the bond and if anyone die indebted to the jews his wife shall have her <UNK> and pay nothing of that debt and if any children of the deceased are left under age <UNK> shall be provided for them in keeping with the holding of the deceased and out of the residue the debt shall be paid reserving however service due to feudal lords in like manner let it be done touching debts due to others than jews after the pope annulled magna carta future versions contained no mention of jews jews were seen by the church as a threat to their authority and the welfare of christians because of their special relationship to kings as <UNK> jews are the sponges of kings wrote the theologian william de <UNK> they are <UNK> of christian <UNK> by whose robbery kings <UNK> and deprive poor men of their goods thus the anti semitic wording as seen in magna carta originated in part because of christian nobles who permitted the otherwise illegal activity of usury a symptom of the larger ongoing power struggle between church and state during the middle ages copies several copies were made each time it was issued so all of the participants would each have one several of those still exist and some are on permanent display the original version of magna carta sealed by king john in one two one five has not survived four contemporaneous copies known as <UNK> remain all of which are located in the uk two held by the british library one at lincoln castle and one at salisbury cathedral

manuscripts barons wars united kingdom constitution english laws in physics the modified newtonian dynamics mond is a burgeoning theory that attempts to explain the galaxy rotation problem by modifying newton s second law of motion the most widely accepted approach to explaining this problem postulates the existence of dark matter mond was proposed in one nine eight three by <UNK> <UNK> the central pillar of mond is the assumption that newton s second law f ma is a high acceleration approximation of a more accurate law that describes all accelerations the proposed modification would only become relevant when the total acceleration of a body falls significantly below the constant a zero consequently observations of this behavior could never be made on earth although <UNK> and others have catalogued a respectable sum of persuasive evidence in favor of mond there has not been enough compelling research to conclusively substantiate or disprove the theory calculations suggest that the parameters required to gather direct experimental evidence can be found only far outside our solar system beyond the overwhelming influence of the sun s gravitational field therefore it will be some time before the validity of mond can be directly tested phenomena such as low surface brightness galaxies have yielded an abundance of indirect evidence on the matter but in the absence of more varied data such successes have been viewed as isolated many researchers have criticized mond for adapting its mathematics to the observed mass discrepancy instead of <UNK> a true physical explanation the theory is the minority view in the astrophysical community overview galaxy dynamics at the start of the one nine eight zero s the first observational evidence was reported that galaxies do not spin as current theories predict a galaxy is a vast group of stars orbiting a bulge at the center of a galaxy since the orbit of stars is driven solely by gravitational force it was expected that stars at the edge would have a much larger orbital period than those near the bulge for example the earth which is one five zero million km from the sun completes an orbit in one year while it takes saturn at a distance of one four billion kilometers from the sun three zero years to do the same a similar behavior was expected from galaxies even if the distribution of stars is more cloud like however it became increasingly apparent that stars at the edge of a galaxy move faster than predicted by conventional theory expected a and observed b galactic rotational curves along with solar rotational curve c postulated dark matter halo around a spiral galaxy astronomers call this phenomenon the flattening of galaxies rotation curve in simple terms drawing a curve to describe the velocity of stars as a function of their distance from the center of a galaxy should yield curve a the dashed line in figure one however data from telescopes yield curve b the plain line instead of decreasing asymptotically to zero as the effect of gravity <UNK> this curve remains flat at large distances from the bulge by comparison the same curve for our solar system properly scaled is provided curve c in figure one reluctant to change newton s law and einstein s theory of relativity for galaxies alone scientists have simply assumed that the rotation curve was flat because of the presence of a large amount of matter outside galaxies their new theory was that galaxies are embedded in a spherical halo of invisible dark matter figure two however the search for dark matter has since been met with limited success the hypothesis of dark matter <UNK> has encountered many problems that have cast doubt on the validity of this model while it is still the most widely accepted model alternative approaches have been considered of which mond is one the mond theory in one nine eight three <UNK> <UNK> a physicist at the weizmann institute in israel published two papers on the astrophysical journal to propose a modification of newton s second law of motion basically this law states that an object of mass m subject to a force f undergoes an acceleration a satisfying the simple equation f ma this law is well known to students and has been verified in a variety of situations however it has never been verified in the case where the acceleration a is extremely small and that is exactly what s happening at the scale of galaxies where the distances between stars are so large that the gravitational force is extremely small the change the modification proposed by <UNK> is the following instead of f ma the equation should be f m a a zero a where x is a function that for a given variable x gives one if x is much larger than one x one and gives x if x is much smaller than one x one the term a zero is a proposed new constant in the same sense that c the speed of light is a constant except that a zero is acceleration whereas c is speed here is the simple set of equations for the modified newtonian dynamics vec m cdot mu left right vec mu x one mbox x gg one mu x x mbox x ll one f m a a zero a x one if x one x x if x one the exact form of is unspecified only its behavior when the argument x is small or large as <UNK> proved in his original paper the form of does not change most of the consequences of the theory such as the flattening of the rotational curve in the everyday world a is much greater than a zero for all physical effects therefore a a zero one and f ma as usual consequently the change in newton s second law is negligible and newton couldn t have seen it since mond was inspired by the desire to solve the flat rotation curve problem it is not a surprise that using the mond theory with observations reconciled this problem this can be shown by a calculation of the new rotation curve mond predicted rotation curve far away from the center of a galaxy the gravitational force a star undergoes is with good approximation f frac with g the gravitation constant m the mass of the galaxy m the mass of the star and r the distance between the center and the star using the new law of dynamics gives f frac m mu right a eliminating m gives frac mu right a we assume that at this large distance r a is smaller than a zero and thus mu right frac which gives frac frac therefore a frac since the equation that relates the velocity to the acceleration for a circular orbit is a frac one has a frac frac and therefore v sqrt four consequently the velocity of stars on a circular orbit far from the center is a constant and doesn t depend on the distance r the rotation curve is flat the proportion between the flat rotation velocity to the observed mass derived here is matching the observed relation between flat velocity to luminosity known as the tully fisher relation at the same time there is a clear relationship between the velocity and the constant a zero the equation v <UNK> zero one four allows one to calculate a zero from the observed v and m <UNK> found a zero one two one zero one zero ms two <UNK> has noted that this value is also the acceleration you get by dividing the speed of light by the lifetime of the universe if you start from zero velocity with this acceleration you will reach the speed of light roughly in the lifetime of the universe <UNK> the impact of assumed value of a a zero for physical effects on earth remains valid had a zero been larger its consequences would have been visible on earth and since it is not the case the new theory would have been inconsistent <UNK> with the observations see scientific method for background information according to the modified newtonian dynamics theory every physical process that involves small accelerations will have an outcome different from predicted by the simple law f ma therefore one needs to look for all such processes and verify that mond remains compatible with observations i e within the limit of the uncertainties on the data there is however a complication overlooked until now but that strongly affects our discussion of the compatibility between mond and the observed world here is the problem in a system considered as isolated for example a single satellite orbiting a planet the effect of mond results in an increased velocity beyond a given range actually below a given acceleration but for circular orbits it is the same thing that depends on the mass of both the planet and the satellite however if the same system is actually orbiting a star the planet and the satellite will be accelerated in the star s gravitational field for the satellite the sum of the two fields could yield acceleration greater than a zero and the orbit would not be the same as that in an isolated system for this reason the typical acceleration of any physical process is not the only parameter one must consider also critical is the process environment which is all external forces that are usually neglected in his paper <UNK> arranged the typical acceleration of various physical processes in a two dimensional diagram one parameter is the acceleration of the process itself the other parameter is the acceleration induced by the environment how does this affect our discussion of mond s application to the real world very simply all experiments done on earth or its neighborhood are subject to the sun s gravitational field this field is so strong that all objects in the solar system undergo an acceleration greater than a zero that s why mond effects have escaped detection therefore only the dynamics of galaxies and larger systems need to be examined to check that mond is compatible with observation since <UNK> s theory first appeared in one nine eight three the most accurate data has come from observations of distant galaxies and neighbors of the milky way within the uncertainties of the data mond has remained valid the milky way itself is scattered with clouds of gas and interstellar dust and until now it has not been possible to draw a rotation curve for our galaxy finally the uncertainties on the velocity of galaxies within clusters and larger systems have been too large to conclude in favor of or against mond is it possible to design an experiment that would confirm mond predictions or rule it out unfortunately conditions for conducting this experiment can be found only outside the solar system however the pioneer and voyager probes are currently traveling beyond pluto and perhaps they have already reached this zone see pioneer anomaly to check that let s calculate the radius of the gravitational sphere of influence of the sun inside which a probe undergoes acceleration greater than a zero we have seen above that the equation relating the acceleration a to the distance r from the sun is frac mu left frac right a so for a a zero assuming a a zero one one with g six six seven one zero eight in cgs units and m the mass of the sun two one zero three three g we get r one zero five one zero one seven cm this is roughly zero zero three four <UNK> or zero one light years over one zero zero times the distance between voyager one the most remote probe and the sun it is therefore doubtful that an experiment could be accurate enough to test the departure from newton s second law perhaps one is less than one but it is very likely greater than zero two consequently experiments on mond will have to wait for the next age of space exploration in search for observations that would validate his theory <UNK> noticed that a special class of objects the low surface brightness galaxies <UNK> is of particular interest the radius of a <UNK> is large compared to its mass and thus almost all stars are within the flat part of the rotation curve also other theories predict that the velocity at the edge depends on the average surface brightness in addition to the <UNK> mass finally no data on the rotation curve of these galaxies was available at the time <UNK> thus could make the prediction that <UNK> would have a rotation curve essentially flat and with a relation between the flat velocity and the mass of the <UNK> identical to that of brighter galaxies since then many such <UNK> have been observed and while some astronomers have claimed their data invalidated mond others have been able to confirm their predictions at the time of this writing the debate is still hot and scientists are waiting for more accurate observations the mathematics of mond in non relativistic modified newtonian dynamics poisson s equation nabla two phi n four pi g rho where phi n is the gravitational potential and rho is the density distribution is modified as nabla cdot left mu left frac right nabla phi right four pi g rho where phi is the mond potential the equation is to be solved with boundary condition left nabla phi right rightarrow zero for left mathbf right rightarrow infty the exact form of mu xi is not constrained by observations but must have the behaviour mu xi sim one for xi one newtonian regime mu xi sim xi for xi deep mond regime under deep mond regime modified poisson equation may be rewritten as nabla cdot left frac nabla phi nabla phi n right zero and that simplifies to frac nabla phi nabla phi n nabla times mathbf the vector field mathbf is unknown but is null whenever the density distribution is spherical cylindrical or planar in that case mond acceleration field is given by the simple formula mathbf m mathbf n sqrt n right where mathbf n is the normal newtonian field discussion and criticisms one reason why some astronomers find mond difficult to accept is that it is an effective theory not a physical theory as an effective theory it describes the dynamics of accelerated object with an equation without any physical justification this approach is completely different from einstein s who assumed that some fundamental physical principles were true continuity smoothness and isotropy of space time conservation of energy principle of equivalence and derived new equations from these principles including the famous e mc and the less famous but extremely powerful g eight t for many mond seems to lack a physical ground some new fundamental principle about matter vacuum or space time that would lead to the modified equation f m a a zero a supporters of mond on the other hand have compared theories of dark matter to the now obscure aether hypothesis which was discarded in favor of a fundamental change in our understanding of light instead of postulating the existence of an invisible influence to explain the observed mass discrepancy supporters of mond believe we should re examine our understanding of acceleration attempts in this direction have essentially been modifications of einstein s theory of gravitation when one looks at the equation f m a a zero a the value of a and the parameter of seem to depend on m as well as f however for the gravitational force f also depends on m therefore a change in newton s second law can be a change of the gravitational force or a change of inertia the two are indistinguishable note that this is not true for example for the electromagnetic force moving in the same weak electromagnetic field two particles with the same charge but with different masses would follow fundamentally different trajectories with the same charge the f term in the mond equation is the same for the two particles however with a different value for m one could have a <UNK> trajectory and not the other even though they are subject to the same force however in interstellar space gravity is the main acting force and since no experiment could be performed on earth to determine whether mond is a new theory of inertia or a new theory of gravity physicists have concentrated their effort on the latter presently they have achieved only partial success devising a more complicated version of einstein s theory of gravitation the most successful relativistic version of mond which was proposed in two zero zero four is known as <UNK> for tensor vector scalar proposed by black hole physicist and <UNK> associate jacob d <UNK> it is currently undergoing scholarly review although this most recent incarnation looks promising and even successfully predicts gravitational lensing one must remember that every relativistic theory of gravitation proposed since the emergence of einstein s theory in one nine one five has been ruled out or abandoned since one way or another only the simplest form of einstein s theory has survived the scientific <UNK> of the past century in the eyes of most cosmologists and <UNK> mond is considered a possible but unlikely alternative to the more widely accepted theory of dark matter as new data is collected both mond and dark matter are <UNK> invalidated and occasionally supported and no observation has yet conclusively settled the debate toward this goal supporters of mond have concentrated their effort on specific areas to determine phenomena predicted by mond and to search for them for example the dynamics of satellites of our galaxy could be distorted by the effects of mond in such a way that would be difficult to explain with a dark matter halo to obtain the relativistic extension of mond that would incidentally help scientists understand how light is bent by galaxies gravitational field although mond cannot currently cope with this <UNK> has shown promise to otherwise establish mond as a theory of inertia and determine its fundamental principles progress in this direction has been minimal another criticism of mond is that it violates occam s razor which states that the simplest explanation is usually correct any modifications to newton s laws can also be explained in terms of distributions of dark matter and the second explanation is simpler in that it requires fewer changes to rigorously established scientific theory however proponents of mond are quick to point out that extremely hypothetical candidates for dark matter such as <UNK> six dimensional dark matter theories and the general requirement that dark matter be evenly distributed through space are no simpler than the idea that gravity acts differently at low accelerations beside mond two other theories that try to explain the mystery of the rotational curves is <UNK> gravitational theory proposed by john <UNK> and weyl s conformal

into some abelian group in the language of convolutions see multiplicative function and dirichlet convolution the inversion formula can also be expressed as one an equivalent formulation of the

victims of the distribution problems with some titles reporting low sales when in fact they were being resold at a later date in the first specialty comic book stores an attempt by marvel to buy dc

or other determinants of social position however the word <UNK> is now often used to describe a type of society where wealth income and social status are assigned through competition on the assumption that the winners do indeed deserve merit their resulting advantage as a result the word has acquired a connotation of social darwinism and is used to describe aggressively competitive societies with large inequality of income and wealth contrasted with egalitarian societies <UNK> governments and organizations stress talent formal education and competence rather than existing differences such as

is a good thing for society proponents of <UNK> argue that a <UNK> system is more just and more productive than other systems and that it allows for an end to distinctions based on such things as sex and race though social classes would still exist young s central criticism of <UNK> was that a system in which social position is determined by objective characteristics would still be <UNK> and unstable there have since been other lines of criticism proponents of critical theory often argue that merit is defined by the power elite simply to <UNK> a system in which social status is actually determined by class birth and wealth often opponents of the concept of <UNK> argue that characteristics such as intelligence or effort are simply impossible to measure accurately for example one may ask who was more intelligent isaac newton or albert einstein therefore in their view any implementation of <UNK> necessarily involves a high degree of <UNK> and is inherently flawed social darwinism social darwinism is a social theory which holds that darwin s theory of evolution by natural selection is not only a model for the development of biological traits in a population but can also be applied to human social institutions social <UNK> was popular in the late one nine th century to the end of world war ii although some have claimed that contemporary sociobiology could be classified as a form of social darwinism proponents of social darwinism often used the theory to justify social inequality as being <UNK> others used it to justify racism and imperialism at its most extreme some social darwinism appears to anticipate eugenics and the race doctrines of the nazis while social darwinism applies the concept of evolution and natural selection to human cultural systems none of the political and quasi theological ideologies related to it are a part of darwin s biological theory of evolution equally social darwinism itself does not necessarily <UNK> a political position some social <UNK> argue for the inevitability of progress while others emphasize the potential for the degeneration of humanity some even attempted to enroll social darwinism in reformist politics the theory of social darwinism draws on the work of many authors including herbert spencer and thomas malthus individual proponents confucius in teaching there should be no distinction of classes analects xv three nine tr legge many western admirers of confucius like voltaire or h g <UNK> have pointed out an innovative and revolutionary idea of confucius he replaced the nobility of blood with one of

shameless son of a king was only a small man that he allowed any kind of student to be his disciple his teachings were intended to train future rulers is a clear indication that he didn t wholly

skill intelligence and initiative this led to the armies of the qin having a critical edge over the other nations that adhered to old aristocratic systems of government legalism along with its anti aristocratic pro <UNK> ideals remained a key part of chinese philosophy and politics for another two millennia although after the qin dynasty it was heavily diluted genghis khan <UNK> was the primary basis for selection of chiefs and generals in the mongol empire genghis khan chose whomever was talented and fit for his military chain of command he even trusted generals and soldiers from opponents

revolutionary france is also sometimes considered to have been <UNK> after the revolution of one seven nine two hardly a member of the former elite remained when napoleon rose to power therefore there

leadership loyalty may have been a more important factor than sheer merit in performance a common case in political situations <UNK> states singapore among modern nation states the republic of singapore claims to aspire to be a pure <UNK> with its supposed emphasis on identifying and grooming bright young citizens for positions of leadership there is also an emphasis on academic credentials these are seen as objective measures of both intelligence and effort which in turn are arbitrarily determined by the ruling party of singapore the people s action party its unwillingness to tolerate political dissent casts some skepticism on its claims of <UNK> and within its party ideology political conformity is a measure of merit thereby distorting its original meaning <UNK> is supposed to be a central political concept in singapore and is at the heart of its founding myth specifically singapore portrays itself as having been expelled from neighbouring malaysia in one nine six five as a result of the unwillingness of its majority immigrant groups especially the ethnic chinese to accept the special position of the indigenous communities especially the malays the federal malaysian government had argued for a system which would give special privileges to the malays as part of their birthright as an indigenous people in time the federal government came to implement an affirmative action policy that favoured the numerically <UNK> but economically backward indigenous groups the singapore government supposedly argued for the equality of all citizens of malaysia with places in universities government contracts political appointments etc going to the most deserving candidate rather than to one chosen on the basis of connections or ethnic background in the ensuing conflict between state and federal governments through the machinations of the politicians of the day singapore was expelled and became an independent city state however the reality of the <UNK> political and economic system is anything but <UNK> double standards exist even politically the only political activism seen since independence was when the government s interests aligned with those of the activists dissidents and seditious activities are not allowed the bulk of the <UNK> economy comprises of government linked companies of which senior members of the people s action party are routinely selected to become directors and <UNK> in a non transparent fashion rather than focusing on other qualities that would determine merit such as experience in running large <UNK> and other more impressive credentials that other candidates may possess the most famous and oft cited example of singapore s alleged <UNK> is that of <UNK> holdings inc the managing director of which the daughter in law of singapore s founding father lee kuan yew ho ching became when there was no shortage of other better qualified candidates grand duchy of finland another example is the one nine th century finland which was formally ruled by an autocrat though in practice governing was left to the educated class although ancestry and inherited wealth influenced one s educational opportunities education

democratic system whereby citizens can choose those they believe to be of the greatest merit and the strong constitutional emphasis on individual rights are all unique developments of western civilization which have the effect of approximating <UNK> better than traditional civilizations although a conflict exists between those who believe that everyone should have the same opportunities

changing use of the term forms of government political neologisms marxism leninism russian strictly speaking refers to the version of marxist theory developed by vladimir lenin see leninism however in various contexts different and sometimes opposing political groups have used the term marxism leninism to describe the ideologies that they claimed to be upholding the purpose of this article is to give an account of the historical and present uses of the label marxism leninism history of the term lenin himself never used the term leninism nor did he refer to his views as marxism leninism however his ideas diverged from classical marxist theory on several important points see the articles on marxism and leninism for more information bolshevik communists saw these differences as advancements of marxism made by lenin after lenin s death his ideology and contributions to marxist theory were termed marxism leninism or sometimes only leninism marxism leninism soon became the official name for the ideology of the comintern and of communist parties around the world within five years of lenin s death joseph stalin completed his rise to power in the soviet union stalin in contrast to many contemporary revolutionaries did not write a significant body of theoretical work stalinism strictly speaking refers to a style of government or political structure rather than an ideology per se during the period of stalin s rule in the soviet union marxism leninism was proclaimed the official ideology of the state whether stalin s practices actually followed the principles of marx and lenin is still a subject of debate amongst historians and political scientists trotskyists in particular believe that stalinism contradicted authentic marxism and leninism and they <UNK> used the term bolshevik leninism to describe their own ideology of anti stalinist and anti maoist communism after the sino soviet split the soviet union and the people s republic of china each claimed to be the sole intellectual heir to marxism leninism in china the claim that mao had adapted marxism leninism to chinese conditions evolved into the idea that he had updated it in a fundamental way applying to the world as a whole consequently the term marxism leninism mao zedong thought commonly known as maoism was increasingly used to describe the official chinese state ideology as well as the ideological basis of parties around the world who sympathized with the communist party of china following the death of mao american <UNK> associated with the revolutionary communist party usa subsequently coined the term marxism leninism maoism arguing that maoism was a more advanced stage of marxism maoist and maoist oriented parties today generally believe that the current leadership of china has abandoned maoism in north korea marxism leninism was officially superseded in one nine seven seven by <UNK> in which concepts of class and class struggle in other words marxism itself play no significant role however the government is still sometimes referred to as marxist leninist or more commonly stalinist due to its political and economic structure see history of north korea the other three communist states existing today cuba vietnam and laos hold marxism leninism as their official ideology although they give it different interpretations in terms of practical policy current usage most communist parties continue to regard marxism leninism as their basic ideology although many have modified it to adapt to new political conditions several communist parties especially those previously associated with <UNK> have distanced themselves from the concept of marxism leninism and in many cases omitted it from their official documents some have started identifying themselves as marxist leninist or marxist and leninist rather than marxist leninist the difference in such cases is that the historical connotation of marxism leninism is avoided in party names the appellation marxist leninist is normally used by a communist party who wishes to distinguish itself from some other and presumably mainstream communist party in the same country most often parties who place the term marxist leninist in their official name are those originating from the anti revisionist tradition such as maoist groups popular confusion abounds concerning the complex terminology describing the various schools of marxist derived thought the appellation marxist leninist is often used by those not familiar with communist ideology in any detail e g many newspapers and other media as a synonym

zero one ever since however modulo has gained many meanings some exact and some imprecise this usage is from gauss s book given the integers a b and n the expression a b mod n pronounced a is congruent to b modulo n means that a and b have the same remainder when divided by n or equivalently that a b is a multiple of n for more details see modular arithmetic in computing given two integers a and n a modulo n is the remainder after numerical division of a by n under certain constraints see modulo operation two members of a ring or an algebra are congruent modulo an ideal if the

two subsets of an infinite set are equal modulo finite sets precisely if their symmetric difference is finite that is you can take a finite piece from the first infinite set then add a finite piece to

gorbachev announced that the soviet economy was stalled and that reorganization was needed initially his reforms were called <UNK> acceleration but later the term perestroika reconstruction became much more popular the first reform introduced under gorbachev was the one nine eight five alcohol reform which was designed to fight wide spread alcoholism in the soviet union prices on vodka wine and

revised to avoid discouraging private sector activity under this provision cooperative restaurants shops and manufacturers became part of the soviet scene gorbachev s introduction of glasnost gave new freedoms to the people such as a greater freedom of speech this was a radical change as control of speech and suppression of government criticism had previously been a central part of the soviet system the press became far less controlled and thousands of political prisoners and many dissidents were released gorbachev s goal in undertaking glasnost was to pressure conservatives within the

democratization of the ussr and eastern europe had <UNK> undermined the power of the cpsu and gorbachev himself gorbachev s relaxation of censorship and attempts to create more political openness had the unintended effect of re awakening long suppressed nationalist and anti russian feelings in the soviet republics calls for greater independence from moscow s rule grew louder especially in the

ukraine armenia and azerbaijan gorbachev had unleashed a force that would ultimately destroy the soviet union gorbachev s response to growing republic separatism was to draw up a new treaty of union

those arrested for high treason include the gang of eight that had led the coup gorbachev had aimed to maintain the cpsu as a united party but move it in the direction of social democracy the inherent contradictions in this approach praising lenin admiring sweden s social model and seeking to maintain the annexation of the baltic states by military force were difficult enough but when the cpsu was proscribed after the august coup gorbachev was left with no effective power base beyond the armed forces in the end yeltsin won them round too with promises of more money gorbachev eventually resigned on december two five one nine nine one as the ussr was officially dissolved gorbachev is generally well regarded in the west for having ended the cold war however in russia his reputation is very low

lexington minuteman representing john parker <UNK> is a name given to members of the militia of the american colonies who would be ready for battle in a minute s notice the term <UNK> has also been applied to various later united states military units to recall the success and patriotism of the originals see <UNK> history as early as one six four five in the massachusetts bay colony some men were selected from the general ranks of town based training bands to be ready for rapid deployment the militia in the province of massachusetts had a long history of extended conflict see king philip s war french and indian wars and battle of lexington and concord every generation of new <UNK> had known fighting every town had a militia and every man between one six and six zero years of age was asked to join most of these men were farmers many were descendants of the few original settlers of each town and so it was very common to be fighting alongside cousins and in laws some towns in massachusetts had a long history of designating a portion of their militia as <UNK> but others <UNK> to keep their entire militia in a single unit after the powder alarm in the fall of one seven seven four patriot leaders in the newly formed massachusetts provincial congress recommended that all militias contain minute companies special units within the militia system whose members underwent additional training and to hold themselves ready to turn out quickly at a minute s notice for emergencies some towns followed this recommendation and altered their unit structures but some took no action the <UNK> were usually two five years of age or younger and they were chosen for their enthusiasm reliability and strength they were the first armed militia to arrive or await a battle officers were elected by popular vote and each unit drafted a formal written covenant to be signed upon enlistment they typically assembled four times per year for training during peacetime it was common sometimes even in the middle of battle for officers to make decisions through consultation with their men as opposed to giving orders to be followed without question popular histories of the battle of lexington and concord in one seven seven five the first battle of the american revolutionary war have often labelled all the irregulars on the american side as <UNK> most notably captain john parker s lexington militia but at the time of the battle all of lexington s militiamen were organized into a single large unit and were still called by the archaic name of town training band other colonies faced with similar problems had organized similar minute companies over time <UNK> became a generic term for any american militia motivation the new england town meeting style of local decision making in combination with the colonial legislature meant that for nearly all functions of government these men had already experienced generations of self rule even though most of them could not express lofty sentiments about the rights of man and the purposes of government they knew that the same british army of professional soldiers who had once fought with them against a common enemy was now in their land to take something important away from them one massachusetts man used the phrase an englishman s home is his castle when he explained to his friends why he had <UNK> himself behind his front door to fight the british army as it passed by during the final phase of the battle of lexington and concord the typical individual american patriot in massachusetts fought for a political idea even at this first stage of the war when independence from great britain was not yet a common sentiment equipment training and tactics most colonial militia units were provided neither arms nor uniforms and so had to equip themselves many simply wore their own farmers or <UNK> clothes while others had <UNK> hunting outfits some added indian style touches to intimidate the enemy even including war paint most used hunting rifles which did not have <UNK> but were accurate at long range the continental army regulars received european style military training later in the american revolutionary war but the militias did not get much of this rather than fight formal battles in the traditional dense lines and columns they were better when used as irregulars primarily as <UNK> and <UNK> their experience suited irregular warfare most were familiar with frontier hunting the indian wars and especially the recent french and indian war had taught both the men and officers the value of irregular warfare while many british troops fresh from europe were less familiar with this the wilderness terrain that lay just beyond many colonial towns very familiar to the local minuteman favored this style of combat the rifled musket used by most <UNK> was also well suited to this role the rifling grooves inside the barrel gave it a much greater range than the <UNK> musket although it took much longer to load because of the lower rate of fire rifles weren t used by regular infantry but were preferred for hunting when performing as <UNK> the <UNK> could fire and fall back behind cover or other troops before the british could get into range the increased range and accuracy of the rifle along with a lifetime of hunting to develop marksmanship earned <UNK> <UNK> a deadly reputation ammunition and supplies were not only in short demand but were constantly being seized by british patrols as a precaution these items were often hidden or left behind by <UNK> in fields or wooded areas other popular concealment methods were to hide items underneath <UNK> in houses and barns legacy concord minuteman in commemoration of the centenary of the first successful armed

meaning fortress it is the site of ancient palaces and fortifications in israel on top of an isolated rock plateau on the eastern edge of the judean desert overlooking the dead sea masada became famous for the seven three ce battle one of the last in the great jewish revolt between the site s jewish defenders and besieging roman troops during which almost all surviving defenders committed mass suicide when defeat became imminent geography masada seen from the east <UNK> at masada where ashes were probably stored the openings have been shown to be too small for pigeons to fit the cliffs on the east edge of masada are about four five zero meters high dropping off to the dead sea and the cliffs on the west are about one zero zero meters high the natural approaches to the cliff top are very difficult the top of the plateau is flat and <UNK> shaped approximately six zero zero by three zero zero meters there was a <UNK> wall around the top of the plateau totalling one four zero zero meters long and four meters thick with many towers and the fortress included <UNK> <UNK> that were <UNK> by rainwater barracks palaces and an armory three narrow winding paths led from below to fortified gates location history according to flavius josephus a one st century jewish historian herod the great fortified masada between three seven and three one bce as a refuge for himself should his jewish subjects rise up against him in six six ce at the beginning of the great jewish revolt against the romans a group of jewish rebels called the zealots heb kana im lit jealous ones commanded by <UNK> ben ya ir took masada from the roman garrison stationed there in seven zero ce they were joined by additional zealots and their families who were expelled from jerusalem by the other jews living there shortly before the destruction of jerusalem and for the next two years used masada as their base for raiding and harassing roman and jewish settlements alike remnants of one of several <UNK> camps at masada just outside the <UNK> wall which can be seen next to it then in seven two ce the roman governor of <UNK> province lucius flavius silva marched against masada with the roman legion x <UNK> and laid siege to the fortress after failed attempts to breach the wall they built a <UNK> wall and then a rampart against the western face of the plateau using thousands of tons of stones and beaten earth josephus does not record any major attempts by the zealots to counterattack the <UNK> during this process a significant difference from his accounts of other sieges against jewish fortresses suggesting that perhaps the zealots lacked the equipment or skills to fight the roman legion it is believed by many that the romans used jewish slaves to build the rampart whom the zealots were reluctant to kill because of their beliefs a shot of the ramp from the top the ramp was complete in the spring of seven three ce after approximately two to three months of siege allowing the romans to finally breach the wall of the fortress with a <UNK> ram when they entered the fortress however the romans discovered that its approximately one thousand defenders had set all the buildings but the food <UNK> ablaze and committed mass suicide rather than face certain capture or defeat by their enemies because the jewish religion discourages the act of suicide however the defenders were reported to have drawn lots and slain each other in turn down to the last man who would be the only one to actually take his own life as per josephus account the argument is made that the <UNK> were left standing to show that the defenders retained the ability to live and chose the time of their death this account of the siege of masada was apparently related to josephus by two
